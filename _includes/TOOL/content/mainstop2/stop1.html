    <p>
      High-throughput drug screening (HTDS) is a method of rapidly screening anywhere from 100,000 to 1,000,0000 of compounds from existing libraries to identify those that have a specific biological activity at the model organism, cellular, pathway, or molecular level. This process is used in early stages of drug discovery to identify potential drug candidates and in drug repurposing to identify new potential uses for existing drugs. The goal of HTDS is to identify active compounds from a library of potential candidates as quickly and efficiently as possible.  Compounds that affect the target in an anticipated way are called hits, and the screens may be restricted to compounds that have already been tested in humans, thereby reducing the need for extensive preclinical tests. These hit compounds become candidates for the starting point for the development of drugs. A HTDS can produce a huge number of hits which are then further optimized and validated to remove any artifacts or ‘noise’ from the screen through further validation testing. The validated hits are studied reducing the number of compounds which then are entered into a lead optimization step to yield a drug candidate to study in clinical trials.

    <p>One important aspect of HTDS that is important to consider is that it can be quite expensive, as it requires access to a highly specialized screening facility and compound libraries which many labs may not be able to afford, though there are third-party providers like Contract Research Organizations (CRO) or core facilities which may reduces costs for nonprofits.
