            There are âˆ¼7000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 individuals in the U.S.A. and 95% of these rare diseases do not have a single Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy. Since the incentives for new drug development for rare diseases are limited, drug repurposing provides a promising way to identify effective treatments for rare diseases faster and cheaper than developing new drugs. Still, many challenges exist in the drug repurposing space.

            <b>The Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP)</b>
            project proposes to fill some of these knowledge gaps through document analysis, surveys and interviews grounded in a participatory design approach. Ultimately, this project aims to not only answer some fundamental questions about the experience of drug repurposing for various stakeholders, but to also design a solution to some of the challenges rare disease organizations are facing through the creation of an interactive tool.
