## BACKGROUND

There are anywhere from 7,000 to 10,000 rare diseases affecting approximately 30,000,000 individuals in the U.S.A. Despite significant investments of resources over the last several decades, most of these rare diseases do not have a single FDA-approved therapy, some estimate that over 90% of rare diseases lack an effective treatment (Kaufmann et al., 2018; Orphanet J Rare Dis). This fact highlights the failure of traditional research approaches to overcome the unique challenges faced by rare disease research. 

In the rare disease space, rare disease non profit organizations are often key players in supporting the patient community through outreach, advocacy, fundraising, financial support, treatment guidance, as well as supporting the researchers and physicians in advancing understanding and treatment options for the rare disease.
Since the incentives for new drug development for rare diseases are limited, drug repurposing provides a promising way to identify effective treatments for rare diseases. 

The basic idea of drug repurposing is that once a treatment has been FDA-approved for one condition, it can be re-approved, or repurposed, to treat other conditions. The same goes for drugs developed for one condition, but proven ineffective or unsafe and thus never approved for the intended condition (this is sometimes referred to as “drug rescue”). 

The repurposing process, in most cases, is considered to be a faster and cheaper way of getting treatments to patients compared to developing new drugs. Because the basic research on the properties of the compound has already been completed, as well as preliminary safety clinical trials, drug repurposing is able to skip many steps and costs. Depending on the new indication and how different it is from the original in both the target disease, population, dosages and modes of administration, drug repurposing could start from Phase II or Phase III clinical trials, and thus it becomes a faster (only 1-3 years to implementation, comparing to the 13-15 years for new drug development) and cheaper ($300 million, compared to $2-3 billion for new drug development (Pushpakom et al., 2019) option to get treatments to patients. 

Additionally, because the repurposed drug has already been proven safe and effective, it has a higher likelihood to succeed in future clinical trials, compared to new, untested compounds - 1/10 success rate vs the 1/10,000 for new drug development (Stone, 2020). 

However, the process has not received enough interest from relevant stakeholders or funding organizations, and most prior drug repurposing efforts are a result of serendipitous discovery rather than a systematic, intentional pursuit (Pushpakom et al., 2019). This is because many challenges exist in the drug repurposing space, namely:

1. lack of a consensus of the roles that various stakeholders play (patient advocacy organizations, researchers, physicians, government, pharmaceutical companies, etc.)
2. lack of a “roadmap” of how rare disease organizations should go about pursuing drug repurposing,
3. lack of support (data, finances, resources, guidelines, etc.) during the drug repurposing process.

## METHODS 

The Repurposing Of All Drugs, Mapping All Paths (ROADMAP) project aims to answer some fundamental questions about the experience of drug repurposing for rare disease nonprofit organizations and their relevant stakeholders and to design a solution to some of the challenges rare disease organizations are facing through the creation of this interactive “ROADMAP” tool. This project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).

The CDCN team established a six-phase project plan for the project:

1. Crowdsourcing Data 
2. Survey Data Analysis
3. Interview Execution
4. Interview Data Analysis 
5. Synthesis & Tool Development
 
This project was submitted for review by Advarra IRB under protocol number Pro00055201 and approved on September 28, 2021. On May 14, 2022 we submitted an update to the protocol, which included our interview protocol and updated project timeline, which was approved May 25, 2022. 

### Crowdsourcing Data 

#### All Rare Disease Nonprofit Organizations in the US

The first dataset we needed was a comprehensive list of all rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US and an understanding of how many of them support research in general and drug repurposing in particular. We quickly discovered this dataset did not exist. In order to gather this data, we put out a call to assemble a team of volunteers through various social networks. We onboarded a small team of volunteers and commenced the first step of our crowdsourced data collection, which consisted of combining several existing lists of organizations (NORD members, Global Genes members, etc.) and then performing additional searches to try to find any other lists or organizations which we could include. The final list consisted of 982 organizations. 

Next, a larger team of 70+ volunteers spent seven months (05/18/2021-12/16/2021) extracting data from the websites of these organizations, looking for:

- Whether the organization satisfied our inclusion criteria: US-based, registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, focused on one or more rare diseases (one that affects less than 200,000 people in the US (Orphan Drug Act, 1983)) and having an active website.
- Basic organizational info: year of founding, name & contact information of founders
- Information as to the organization’s resources: conference, research agenda, biobank, registry, natural history study, etc.
- Whether the rare disease has treatment guidelines, or whether it is known that it is caused by a genetic mutation
- Any mention of drug repurposing, and if so - which drug(s) were pursued
- Any mention of partnerships or collaborations with other organizations 
 
As a result of this exercise, 711 organizations were confirmed as rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US with active websites as of 12/2021. This dataset has been made available open-source at [url here]. 

#### UpToDate Data on Off-label use

Separately, we onboarded a team of 10 extractors which had some medical expertise or medical educational background. We took a subset of 100 rare diseases from our ROADMAP survey data and conducted an extraction process of identifying how many of these rare diseases had off-label drugs as a part of the official treatment guidelines on UpToDate.com, a well known and trusted electronic clinical resource tool for physicians. From 2/17/2022 to 7/14/2022, the team extracted every drug mentioned on the UpToDate page regarding a specific rare disease in the list and coded the drug entry on its “context” and “status”.

**Context** refers to how the drug was mentioned on the UpToDate page. The options were “Context: Drug is recommended or listed as potentially helpful” and “Drug listed as does not work for this disease AND/OR no longer given AND/OR not recommended”. 

**Status** refers to the drugs’ approval status. The options were:

- FDA approved for another disease
- FDA approved for this rare disease
- Not FDA approved for anything 

The goal of this data extraction was to understand the current state of rare disease treatment. A common statistic that is utilized everywhere is that 95% of rare diseases do not have an FDA approved treatment. As far as we know, this statistic is never cited to any original research or dataset, so it is not clear how accurate or up to date it is. Furthermore, it does not tell us how many of these rare diseases have off-label (FDA approved for another disease, but not FDA approved for that rare disease) treatments available for them. This is crucial information for us to understand the state of rare disease treatment in the US and the need for drug repurposing. 

### Survey Execution

We designed a survey and implemented in with the Qualtrics platform, with question sections for several different stakeholder types: (1) rare disease nonprofit organization leaders, (2) rare disease patients, (3) rare disease patients’ loved one (parent, spouse, friend, sibling, etc. of a rare disease patient), (4) physicians who treat rare diseases, (5) rare disease researchers. 

Any member of the leadership team of a US-based rare disease-focused nonprofit organization were able to participate in this research project. They were then invited to directly reach out to their US-based patient, loved one, physician and researcher network and invite them to take the survey. Since rare diseases predominantly affect children, we allowed participants under 18 to participate in the project through an adult loved one who provided informed consent and took the survey. Additionally, since many rare diseases cause physical and cognitive disabilities, we allowed those patients to also participate in the survey through a loved one, regardless of the patient’s age in that case. Also, we included an option for patients and loved ones to participate in Spanish, since we anticipated that a large portion of the population might not be fluent English speakers. 

Each of these stakeholders had a unique insight into drug repurposing for rare diseases that we wanted to capture: 

For rare disease nonprofit organization leaders we were focusing on capturing their organizational characteristics (age, funding, staff size, etc.), level of resources (biobank, patient registry, natural history study, scientific advisory board. etc), rare disease state of research (availability of treatment guidelines, diagnostic criteria, ICD code, biomarkers, etc.), any FDA or off label drugs utilized for their rare disease of focus as well as their efficacy, availability and access, their drug repurposing experience, including challenges they’ve encountered, support they need, and who was in their collaboration network. 

For rare disease patients and their loved ones (these stakeholders received the same set of questions) we were interested in their experience with off label drugs for their rare disease, including roadblocks in access, as well as their general attitude towards and comfort level with drug repurposing. 

For physicians, we were mainly interested in the frequency and ​factors taken into consideration when deciding to prescribe a drug off-label, off-label drug prescription practices for the rare diseases they treat, as well as their levels of involvement in clinical trials for rare diseases. 

For researchers, we asked questions regarding their involvement in research projects to advance drug repurposing for any rare diseases, what their motivations are, what challenges they’ve encountered, levels of availability of research tools, techniques, and levels of funding to support drug repurposing research. 
 
Preliminary Interviews
We conducted 10 preliminary semi-structured interviews with a selection of rare disease nonprofits. The goals of these meetings were to get their general thoughts about the project and obtain their feedback on our survey drafts. This information was used to refine the survey and communication materials.

Survey Dissemination 
As described in a prior section, we had previously compiled a comprehensive list of US-based rare disease organizations. We had also collected email addresses from these organizations’ websites. This contact list was utilized to email an invitation to participate in the project. Since this project is supported by a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the survey was also disseminated by the CZI leadership team to the organizations as a part of their Rare As One initiative (cite). 

The survey was officially launched on 9/29/2021 and stayed open for data collection until 1/6/2022. Because the survey included several sections and many of the respondents represented multiple stakeholders and were able to opt into multiple sections at once, we opted to mark all surveys in progress as “complete” at the end of the data collection period in order to not lose completed sections if the respondents opted into several sections and did not complete one or more. In total, we received 1,923 total survey responses (completes and incompletes), which, after data cleaning and deduplication, included 147 organization representatives, 340 patients, 170 loved ones, 23 physicians and 43 researchers. According to our crowdsourced data, there are 711 active rare disease nonprofit organizations in the US. This means that our 147 organizations constitute 20.7% of the total sample size and response rate, which is significant. Though there is an obvious selection bias to organizations who are interested or pursuing drug repurposing to take our survey, we are confident that we were able to capture a good variety of organizations based on a variety of different characteristics.

Follow up Survey
During early stage analysis, an error in the Qualtrics platform was identified in which a significant section of the patient/loved one survey was not shown to any participants. Because the participants in the survey were able to voluntarily consent to email follow ups and provide their email addresses, those participants who opted into the patient/loved one survey and provided consent and contact information were then sent a follow up survey which contained these questions. ____ patients and loved ones were contacted to participate in the follow up survey, __200 responded and we were able to successfully match 191 to their original responses, 156 of which remained after data cleaning and became a part of the full dataset for analysis.
