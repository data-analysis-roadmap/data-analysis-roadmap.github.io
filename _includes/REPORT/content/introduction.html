    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>Throughout 2021-2022 the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN) has conducted a survey of US-based rare disease non profit organizations (RDNPs) and their stakeholder populations (patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers). </p>
    
    <p>
        We had 147 organizations participate, and along with their stakeholders we received over 1,900 survey responses. </p>
    
        <p>
        
        In the following report, we would like to present a high-level overview of the findings from our data to help provide answers to some fundamental questions regarding the state of rare disease drug repurposing in the US.</p>
    
    
    
    
        <h2>ROADMAP survey</h2>
        <p>
            The CDCN reached out to 755 US-based rare disease non-profit organizations on 9/29/2021,  and throughout the next two months 147 (19.4%) organizations participated in the survey. _____/% of these also forwarded the survey on to their patient, loved one, physician and researcher communities.

    <h2>Stakeholder group representation among RDNP leadership</h2>
    
    <p>Interestingly, more than 65% of the rare disease organization representatives themselves are also representatives of these other stakeholder groups. </p>
    
    <p>  Most of these (67, 25%) are also rare disease patient's loved ones, which include parents, spouses, siblings, etc. </p>

    <h2>Rare diseases of focus</h2>
    
    <p>
      Generally, all 147 organizations who participated in the survey focused on either a unique rare disease or set of diseases. Only Usher Syndrome and Neurofibromatosis had two organizations each in our dataset.
