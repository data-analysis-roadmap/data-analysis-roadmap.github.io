So there was JAGA 1 , um, and then bags. So there were, there have been two iterations of the clinical trial at, you know, at CHOP, basically, first started at Washington, Children's National in Washington, DC. And then when Dr. Vanderver moved in 2016 to CHOP, then the trial moved with her, and then it was like, temporarily, like not enrolling while they were getting set up, like, um, getting really stuck. And then, which is why my daughter couldn't get access to it immediately. And so then it started re-enrolling children at CHOP in like, 2016, 2017.

Yeah, I just put the link in. So what Devon just [audio cuts out] described about interferon when the neurologist went to Philadelphia. And they started enrolling a lot more AGS patients all still under the original compassionate use trial.

And I think that that puts us more in the position to like invite people to come in with, you know, a particular drug or agent. It kind of gives us the power where otherwise, you know, they're doing everything, like we're getting scraps of information, whatever they're willing to provide, I think we need to flip that over.

She, she started a trial with children with interferonopathy, so a classic disease driven by dysfunction of interfereons, inflammatory cytokines.

AGSAA.txt,,,,"So before we get anywhere near the clinic, there's a geneticist in the UK that's been studying AGS for like two decades or something like that. So a basic understanding of the mechanics of the disease led to, they published a paper I want to say in like 2005, or something like that, but they talked about a bunch of potential agents, and I can actually find the paper for you if you want, but by, the bench research, um, basically teased out the pathway. And they listed a bunch of potential agents or potential pathways to target and they mentioned by name JAK inhibitors. And so the JAK-STAT pathway is implicated, you know, in the, driving the inflammatory response. And so, they actually did some, like single patient type things with another JAK inhibitor, Ruxolitinib. And so he's a clinical geneticist. So, you know, some, some combination of this, like basic research and extremely small sample, you know, single patient studies, I think they did like two of them showed that it worked on AGS. So it's not, it's not so connected to AGS when you get to Baricitinib, though because, maybe this rough understanding of this, this pathway led the doctor at the NIH to start doing some like really basic stuff with Baricitinib. But I don't think that she necessarily targeted AGS, it was a related diseases CANDLE and Sati, and one of the patients was undiagnosed. And it turned out he had AGS. Right. So it's almost like we stumbled into it for AGS.

Speaker 1  24:48  
They were looking at the skin component as well, like that was like, it was heavily influenced by trying to resolve skin manifestations of the interferonopathy. And I think that because of the rheumatoid arthritis like, component, there was a link there.

It had been underway, I think, like three years when, before we went on the trial. Does that sound right to you, Patrick? Like Rafa went on in 2017. And I think it was two to three years prior to that, but we could find that out.

And it was super frustrating and, and then Lilly basically like shut like closed the shutters, closed the doors, like just stopped talking to us, I tried so many different ways to like, reach out to them. And then essentially, we thought that they were going to apply just on behalf of Baricitinib for, they meaning Lilly, apply for Baricitinib for children with AGS, but they ended up doing like I forget what it was called, but it was like a batch application where they tried to push through like eight different disease designations that were, that had, were in various stages of having proof points for efficacy, safety, completely different diseases. completely, like different designations, completely different, like timelines in terms of like how far along they are with, within, within their trials, and within their research and preclinical like data, and like, all those things. And so then basically, everything got denied. And then Lilly was like, Yeah, we're not going to do it again. So this is my understanding of all of this. And then I was not able to talk to doctor our two main doctors at CHOP, um, Dr. Laura Adang and Dr. Adeline Vanderver about it any longer, because they had to sign an NDA with Lilly that said that they like could not talk about what had happened at the FDA, or something super annoying and like weird like that. And so, and then the pandemic happened, like, like, a few weeks later. So I think the date may have been like, February 12, that's standing out in my head, but like, you know, so and then Lilly pivoted, um, you know, to, to COVID related stuff.

You kind of shook your head.

Speaker 2  10:08  
No. So we, so I had read about drug repurposing, like not necessarily related to our disease or our category of diseases. But so, I understood the concept like similarly to like how Patrick described it, but because this, it was kind of like, oh, nothing, you know, when you read about AGS, a lot of the information is outdated, and it's like, okay, your child has this hideous disease, and there's no cure, there's nothing like it, this is the progression, this is what's going to happen. So that's what's kind of announced to every family, by a genetic counselor by their pediatrician or like, whoever. And then as parents you're like, Oh, my God, like, you know, like, just, it's just an extremely crazy, surreal experience. And then, and then basically, they're scrambling to find like, you know, who knows anything about this disease. And so the doctors that know anything about this disease, we're working on putting together a drug trial, a compassionate use clinical trial that was based off of Raphaela Goldbach-Mansky's work at the NIH on the interferonopathy treatment trial. And that was repurposing a drug that was used for rheumatoid arthritis. So that was kind of like how this came to be. And then in terms of like, so we didn't have to fundraise for that specific opportunity, necessarily, because there was like a donation that was anonymously given or inspired by AGSAA, and they were, you know, and then it kind of went to the doctor directly. And then this was the project that she was working on. So then it was added to that, basically, like those efforts. So the money was kind of funneled into that. And then Lilly was providing the drug, was providing the drugs. So that covered a lot of the costs. And then they were providing some of the costs associated with the compassionate use trial. But then everything else, it was like families had to provide their own funding to go to CHOP to,  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, CHOP, to be able to, you know, you, there was just so, so it's kind of like we were led along this journey. And then with the understanding that with an efficacious trial that had longitudinal data, like safety information, and all that it was proven that it would work that it would then be, it would go into like the FDA process and be approved.",,,,,GENERAL: Interest in DR
AGSAA.txt,,,,"we don't have good dynamic biomarkers. So that's kind of a basic science problem that we have for the disease. And then, you know, in neurodevelopmental disorders, it seems like people really want to measure things related to disability, right? Are you able to improve a person's neurological development. So for this, this Baricitinib trial that, you know, is sort of our initial experience, in Philadelphia, they spent a lot of time coming up with a custom scale, because children with AGS, typically zero out on, on the standard things like gross motor function measure, you know, manual mobility, like occupational therapy type scores. So it's really difficult to measure them in those ways. So come, you know, so we have this dual problem from a, from like, a laboratory perspective, it's very difficult to show that things are working. And then also from a, you know, outcome perspective, it's very difficult. I see the, oh, and then safety too is really difficult, because we're talking about, most likely, we'll be talking about repurposing autoimmune drugs. You know, our kids already suffer cytopenias pretty regularly without treatment, that the introduction of immunosuppression complicates that a lot. So, the FDA originally rejected the Baricitinib application on safety concerns. And so it just so happens that this is a little bit of a tangent, but I saw yesterday that, Devon, I don't know if you saw Laura Adang published, it was kind of a study trying to demonstrate the incidence of cytopenia, various cytopenias in AGS, before and after treatment, and I think that is their, I haven't talked to her about this, but I think that is their, like intentional effort to try and like answer the safety concerns. So you know, on these multiple dimensions, it's difficult to measure, you know, our kids are very disabled, they already suffer some pretty extreme events related to the disease anyway. So, you know, we have this very complicated mix. There's multiple organ systems involved. So that's why I say I know it will fail. And I think you haven't asked me how I think we solve that problem. But I think we solve it by, Devon alluded to the, the academic literature is out of date, with respect to a lot of things about AGS.

But I do, I can agree with you that it seems like there are aspects, and the FDA is a very large organization, but it seems like there's aspects of the FDA and NIH that want to support rare diseases. But for example, I'm not sure if you're a member of the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network, the RDCRN. But they're, they're always talking about PROs, patient reported outcomes, you know, but then when you ask who has done this successfully, and successfully applied and, and used them in a clinical trial, they've never been used as a primary outcome, it's always been some sort of like secondary ignorable outcome, the people that are gonna be reviewing applications in the FDA are not the people in the rare disease program, often this is of the NIH that are supporting us. So there is a disconnect, we hear and I see people wanting to support rare diseases, but when it when it comes to like the end, you know, where you go up against the regulatory agency for real, I think that's where it just drops off.

Speaker 1  1:52  
No, those happened quite a while ago, maybe even 15 years ago, trying to figure out how to treat and or cure Alkaptonuria. And it's such a rare disease, the headquarters for all of the various organizations is in the United Kingdom. And that's where it all began, and where they started the, a launch of the, what's called the Black Bone disease that, you know, it's always easier to come up with a name that people can remember, instead of Alkaptonuria, a little bit difficult. And we basically just call it AKU. And so it was, a foundation originally that was set up by one person who had the disease. And then you know, the goal is in helping patients, educating patients, and definitely the, the ultimate goal for finding a cure. And in that process, it was all the dissection and understanding of the disease is what brings you to a point of saying, Okay, well, what we need to do is stop this process, which was, is an enzyme process that happens in Alkaptonuria, very similar to tyrosinemia, which is a disease in infants that can, they can die from if they're not treated. And so then it became an idea of studying the parallels where, oh okay, well, this is treating in infants and taking care of that problem, it's the same enzyme process. In Alkaptonuria, let's see if it will work there. And it worked amazingly well. And so, they had clinical trials initially, just you know, getting all of the, the definitions of what are the, the issues that AKU patients face? And what are they caused by? And they are caused by the production of Homogentisic acid. HGA. And it was discovered that when patients took Nitisinone, it reduced by 95%, the production of HGA, and this acid actually goes through our bodies and gets rid of all our cartilage. So it's bone on bone, joints have to be replaced, it thickens the valves in the heart, it can cause eye problems. So there, there are a number of high cost insurance issues out there. And so to find something that would stop that from happening, because the first 30 years of my life, I had a normal life, there was there was nothing strange about it. But during that entire time, the HGA was destroying all my cartilage. So then I began to notice cracking in my knees and, and things that, that would happen there. So the whole goal is find something that's going to work, get it started, you know, when they're 20s or even earlier. So that never happens in the first place. So then it's not really curing it, but it's taking away the cause of all of the bad things that happen in AKU so that they can, people can live a normal healthy life. So that's, that's how the, the correlation was made was in discovering what causes AKU. And that tyrosinemia was in the same pathway, more severe than AKU, but in the same pathway, so could the drug that's being used to treat that work for AKU. So that started the clinical trials, both in North America and in all across Europe, they have a better situation, because of the basis of the disease, it's a recessive gene in both parents. So in the smaller communities in Europe, where they always marry within their, their country, they're much more likely to have it. So they have many, just pockets of populations of people with AKU there. So it was easier to get patients and to have them come a short trip, as opposed to in the United States where people might actually came from Europe, but even, you know, California to Washington, DC, I just was there last week, that was the travel I was doing every two or three years, they have us come back there, it's a long time to travel. And the older you get, the more uncomfortable it is because you can't really sit in one position at the same time. So the difficulties we have in North America are a little different. And so we're, we're watching and participating in what's going in, on in the UK and changing our efforts based on what they've discovered.

Ania K  6:45  
Okay, so I think you've, you've kind of mentioned a lot of things, so just want to reiterate. So the general focus kind of came from both an understanding of the disease, and that kind of brought to the like, what needs to be targeted. So that was one of the pathways, then also looking at kind of similar diseases and seeing what works for them. So kind of those two pathways led to this specific drug repurposing.

Sort of like that. It's sort of like chapters. I think there are nine, maybe 10. Italy, France, Romania, Slovakia, Germany, India, North America. I'm sure I'm leaving some out, but there, any place where they have pockets of people that they know have AKU, the group in the UK will go to that country and meet with people to see who, who was interested in, in heading up that organization. And then they, they, they support us, educate us on what we're supposed to be doing, what the, what the issues are going to be.

Yes, for tyrosinemia.

Well, I don't know that, I know in the materials that I provide to patients who contact me, whether they know about Nitisinone or not, I always provide them with that information, and my doctor has, has agreed to talk to any of their physicians. So I provide her contact information. And EMA approval hasn't come into that, originally working with my doctor, we were denied by insurance companies for I think, at least three rounds ... I mean, you can always appeal and say, Well, no, you need to take this into consideration. So by the end, we had a really good package, put together that addressed all of the information. And so sharing that with other physicians, I, there's been no one that's been denied this package, to use it off label.

Yeah, that didn't seem to work very well. But, but with the insurance companies, we can push the HGA thing. Because that's part of the, the argument that we pose is here are all these references that prove that everything that happens, all the deterioration physically in AKU patient is caused by Homogentisic acid. So if you can stop that, then none of those things will happen. And so that case is made. And then all of the things that do happen when, when you don't do that, it's easy for them to put that together. We don't have to put that in their, in their face.

But I think the, the Anthem Blue Cross, you know, mainstream ones are in, on board. So that one's not as difficult, and that it makes a difference when they know.

And in identifying those in the various countries, I mean, in North America, that's our job is to try and stay on top of what's going, on being as visual as you can, so that organizations know you exist. And we did develop a relationship with a prominent university and gene transfer organization, which I don't know if I can disclose their names, so I won't, who contacted me because they needed to find a test to find out if one of the animals in their trial actually had AKU because they were, they had discovered this by accident. And so that's how we got introduced. And we had a couple of zoom meetings with them along with researchers and physicians in Europe. And they were also a, there's a virtual component always to the meetings that we have once a year because many patients are not ambulatory. And so they can still participate, they can still listen and feel a part of it.

Speaker 1  26:56  
Right. Yeah, there, phenylketonuria is another one that's sort of in that same pathway and, and also is in many ways as far as daily life, tyrosinemia and phenylketonuria are much more in your face, so to speak.

AKUSociety.txt,,,,"So that's the, one of the biggest challenges we've had, and the one that I've mostly been working on is, is finding people, trying to set up a situation where we can go to meetings where physicians who would be most likely to discover a patient with AKU would be, and letting them know about us, communicating with all the patients that we find their doctors, getting them enrolled and involved in the NIH history trial. So they're getting, you know, really good attention and education on all the various aspects of the drug, of their disease, and of Nitisinone. And working, my patient, my physician has been really great in contacting all of the experts in the UK and in the United States, getting educated herself, reading the scientific publications, and was able to get insurance approval for me to be on Nitisinone off label. And I actually went maybe six years ago to the UK because we were contacted by Cycle Pharmaceuticals who has made another drug, now that it's off patent, they have their own version, which is a little bit different. It doesn't require refrigeration, which is a good thing, the other one did. And they are working with the United States and going to the FDA meetings to get this approved under, uh repurposing.",,,,,
AKUSociety.txt,,,,"And it was discovered that when patients took Nitisinone, it reduced by 95%, the production of HGA, and this acid actually goes through our bodies and gets rid of all our cartilage. So it's bone on bone, joints have to be replaced, it thickens the valves in the heart, it can cause eye problems. So there, there are a number of high cost insurance issues out there. And so to find something that would stop that from happening, because the first 30 years of my life, I had a normal life, there was there was nothing strange about it. But during that entire time, the HGA was destroying all my cartilage. So then I began to notice cracking in my knees and, and things that, that would happen there. So the whole goal is find something that's going to work, get it started, you know, when they're 20s or even earlier. So that never happens in the first place. So then it's not really curing it, but it's taking away the cause of all of the bad things that happen in AKU so that they can, people can live a normal healthy life. So that's, that's how the, the correlation was made was in discovering what causes AKU. And that tyrosinemia was in the same pathway, more severe than AKU, but in the same pathway, so could the drug that's being used to treat that work for AKU.

It's not an instant overnight, except for the HGA and I think that's one reason why it would never be the only endpoint, because yeah, okay it works. But is it going to change anything in the future? And that's what took the time to actually look through over many years.

Ania K  39:22  
Okay, so that, so those were finished, you got EMA, EMA approval. And now there's an ongoing history trial in the US, and there was an NIH trial that didn't have that endpoint. And that's finished now. Is that correct?

Speaker 1  7:20  
No, no, both of those things. One of the potential side effects of taking Nitisinone is it can raise your tyrosine levels, which can then become dangerous for other health reasons. So finding a drug that could block that production of tyrosine as a side effect is one of the things we're actively pursuing. And we've been talking and pursuing collaborations with the scientists in the UK about gene transfer, the, manipulating the gene, trying to stop it at an earlier point, or having something that you could use later on. And there have been a number of companies, both in the United States and in Europe that are in that area, and working in rare diseases, so we're trying to collaborate with them, and try and get an actual cure going as well. But in the meantime, just getting this drug that's already out there and had all the safety studies done, accessible for AKU patients, who's, was, was the easiest route, we thought. Nothing's easy, but.

Speaker 1  7:20  
Right. Okay. So it's kind of, the drug repurposing is kind of a short term, potentially easier solution to maybe have an effect now, but not like, you're not hoping for it as a like a long term cure, like you're also kind of in parallel exploring other avenues as well? 

Speaker 1  8:51  
Right, exactly. Things that would be more permanent, didn't require taking something every day. And, and the, the side effects that can come from that. 

Ania K  9:01  
Right, because there's, yeah, there's, so there's side effects and yeah, and, so the dosage, how often you need to take it in I guess, are also things you're exploring with the novel drug development. 

Speaker 1  9:11  
Right. 

Ania K  9:12  
Cool, great. With the, with these three different focuses, how would you say if you're comfortable discussing as some people are kind of, with financial questions also, always feel free to tell me if you're not comfortable discussing it, but would you be comfortable at least getting me a sense of like, percentage wise of how, how much you're investing into like novel drug development versus gene therapy versus drug repurposing?

Speaker 1  9:41  
Well, all of, you know, as a nonprofit organization that we don't have steady income from anywhere, so we have to go out and raise the funds. So we have focused most of our efforts on joint fundraising programs to support the program that was taking place in the UK and was successful, the drug was approved in Europe. And, so that, that sort of helped to lay the groundwork for us where they had a population that was easily accessible. We have had a clinical trial going on here on the history of AKU, which is very helpful in, in data that needs to be gathered to, to get a drug approved, whether it's repurposing or a novel drug. And that's funded by the government. And quite a bit, I would, I'm just gonna guess 80% of all of the funding of the studies in the UK was government funding, and the rest was fundraising, and doing that with all of the societies in the world getting together, and then contrib- having all of the funds go to that program there. So now that that's approved, it's a redirecting of, of getting the same approval here in the United States. We actually, the group in the, at the NIH, in Washington, DC, went through clinical trial, but the endpoints the FDA put on it were so subjective, there was, there was no way to meet them. You know, I'm 68 years old, I'm working full time, I've had three joints replaced, I have a fairly regular life, play golf twice a week, but you can look at another 68 year old who's completely crippled, having heart problems. It has so much requirement for pain medications, that, that is not a good quality of life. So you know, you've got two people completely different. So you can't say, well, it has to be this endpoint, because it's not going to be the same. And so one of the primary endpoints for the Europe trial, trial was to measure the reduction of HGA, the acid that's causing all of these problems. But it's not the only one. And the FDA won't accept that as, as it's only endpoint, I'm sure. Because they, they have multiple things that they want to look at, and not something, you know, something so easy. I mean, it's very easy. They just sample the urine, and they can tell immediately if it's there or not. So, so that's, that's the difficult part. And so that, the first trial in the United States did not meet the endpoints enough in any [stutter] - for people who are on Nitisinone, did their range of motion get better, get worse. It's just so subjective between one patient to another, it was difficult to prove that, so now we're at a point in the United States where we're looking at all the data that was gathered in, in the, in Europe, and they're meeting with the FDA to see what can they do. So they are meeting with a rare disease group within the CDER [Center for Drug Evaluation and Research

Well, that, our latest fund raising effort actually, still with UK, all of the societies all go together. Because it's rare. I mean, there's just not enough in one area to support it. We only know of about 275 patients in North America. So, you know, to get funding and start a registry for 275. It's not much, so it's a worldwide thing, and the registry has begun. And that's one of the things that they will track there. And all of it is, is accessible by all of the societies. So we do have, we will have access to it, we just finished the funding and I guess it was Thanksgiving was the, the last funding effort. Funding was done, so now all of the, everything's being put in place for that to move forward. So that will certainly help in keeping track of all, I mean, I have records myself, but you know, the United States has very tight regulations on sharing health data and all that. So at this point, everything is, is fairly private, and I try not to have everything, you know, in my head as a, as a data point. So just general things. Of course, Dr. [Wendy] Introne at the NIH has everything in detail. But amazingly, she cannot share most of that with me. They're just, the HIPAA, HIPAA guidelines, and everything else just doesn't, doesn't require it. We talked, when we were talking about the registry, one of the things we talked about was having her just send an email out all to her whole group, just to let them know who we are, and what's going on, and the NIH wouldn't allow it. So even though she has the contacts, she, she can't do it, she can however, when they come to visit, she lets them know, gives them our website and says, you know, you can contact the organization, and they're happy to help you with all sorts of things.

So in the smaller communities in Europe, where they always marry within their, their country, they're much more likely to have it. So they have many, just pockets of populations of people with AKU there. So it was easier to get patients and to have them come a short trip, as opposed to in the United States where people might actually came from Europe, but even, you know, California to Washington, DC, I just was there last week, that was the travel I was doing every two or three years, they have us come back there, it's a long time to travel. And the older you get, the more uncomfortable it is because you can't really sit in one position at the same time. So the difficulties we have in North America are a little different.

Sort of like that. It's sort of like chapters. I think there are nine, maybe 10. Italy, France, Romania, Slovakia, Germany, India, North America. I'm sure I'm leaving some out, but there, any place where they have pockets of people that they know have AKU, the group in the UK will go to that country and meet with people to see who, who was interested in, in heading up that organization. And then they, they, they support us, educate us on what we're supposed to be doing, what the, what the issues are going to be. Nick Sireau was the chairman of the board of UK, came to America and met with our group and chose people to work here and actually was the president of the AKUSociety of North America for the first, maybe one to two years, while he sort of trained us and what to do and how to move things forward, and then he was focusing more on the clinical trials and getting the Nitisinone approved in Europe. And so, left the board, then he came back when things were closing down there, and is part of the board now and helping us work through with the FDA to get it approved here. So he is definitely the primary resource who's connected with all of the doctors and researchers in Europe and in the United States to try and put everything together, make it work.

So they're getting, you know, really good attention and education on all the various aspects of the drug, of their disease, and of Nitisinone. And working, my patient, my physician has been really great in contacting all of the experts in the UK and in the United States, getting educated herself, reading the scientific publications, and was able to get insurance approval for me to be on Nitisinone off label. And I actually went maybe six years ago to the UK because we were contacted by Cycle Pharmaceuticals who has made another drug, now that it's off patent, they have their own version, which is a little bit different. It doesn't require refrigeration, which is a good thing, the other one did.

No changes have actually been made. But I'm a huge proponent like, yeah, like if a drug is healing people, like change the label and take it off.

Because it was so personal based on your, your, your data and your, all of your effort. So I don't know if somebody would like follow this step by step essentially

Speaker 1  35:02  
I think what I would encourage, yeah, if someone were to try to follow a similar approach, I think the, the point here is that like, you can learn a lot about an individual patient from digging into their data and finding a drug for them. But the really important thing is, once you do that, I think you need to do two things. One is you need to try to figure out how widely, how common is it across other patients. And so we've had really extensive work to study the mTOR pathway in other Castleman patients. So, if your rare disease researcher X, I think the key thing is if you do this sort of like N equals one really personalized therapeutic identification, I think you have to then follow it up by running a lot of the same studies or even new studies on other patients, understand how widespread is this. So you got to do that. And then third, you have to track when people do get it, how well they do. And, you know, hopefully people join registries but, but definitely track whether it's a registry or clinical trial, and then be prepared for the fact that it's not going to work in everyone. And that's really, really disappointing. You know, you find a drug that you think is going to be the sort of solution for everyone, the first three patients were treated with this, had like miraculous responses. So then that to me, you know, it was only three patients, but I was like, this is gonna work for everyone. And it turns out that it actually only works, I've, my guesstimate, is somewhere around 15% to 20%. It just so happened that our first three all had incredible responses.

CDCN.txt,,,,"he machine gun version of Ruxolitinib. So. So the first part of it was that we did serum proteomics, that same proteomic thing, but we did it on about 80 patients, 88 patients, I think, and we found out that there was a signature within the protein levels of those patients that suggested that this particular pathway, not mTOR, but a new one, called JAK/STAT seemed to be involved, basically, a bunch of proteins that are involved in that pathway were really high. And proteins that weren't involved in the pathway weren't high. And so it was like, oh, maybe the pathway is doing something. And so that was step one. Step two was then to go into lymph nodes from Castleman patients, and to look for the downstream product of that pathway, which is called Stat3. And we found that it was highly activated in lymphoid tissue. So like, a pathway basically works in like a circuit. So it's like step 12345. And if you look at, if the fifth step is really high, then you can presume that that means that the pathway is turned on, if that makes sense. So it's like, so it's like we found evidence of the whole path goes on in the blood. We looked at the last step, we found that it was really high in lymphoid tissue. And then we did some experimental studies in the lab where we actually treated Castleman patients' cells, with cytokines and with this drug, and we saw that there were some changes that looked promising, it looked like it was doing some good stuff in the lab.

CDCN.txt,,,,"so it really goes back to when I was, at this stage, the beginning of my fourth year of med school. So as you know, I got sick during my third year of med school with Castleman disease. And you know, but obviously had a horrible about six month period hospitalized. And it really started when I relapsed, there's a drug called Siltuximab that is approved for Castleman disease. And I had been on it for about a year, and I failed to, our relapse falls on that drug. And when I relapsed, I was informed that there were no more drugs in development, and that there was like, no other leads. It's like, all we know about Castleman disease, is IL-6, this thing blocks IL-6 and you can get better. And so once I knew that I was like okay, well, how can we find something that can be helpful for me, and it was very much helpful for me, like that was sort of the thought, it was like very much myopically focused on me, but, and a couple of things happened. One is that I had been a part of the Orphan Disease Center. So I knew how expensive it was to develop a new drug from scratch, I knew how much time it took. So that was sort of off the table. It was like, Well, I'm not going to live that long. I don't have that many resources to do this. Like that's, so the sort of developing a drug from scratch just wasn't feasible. And, and then I started thinking about all the drugs I'd gotten over the course of my illness, a bunch of different chemo therapies, like chemo is what really saved my life and, and I realized that none of them were approved. It's like, wait a minute, like, I'm already being treated with repurposed drugs, like there's all these drugs I've gotten. They weren't made for Castleman, they weren't approved for Castlemans. So like, what about all the other drugs that also weren't made for Castleman disease, and also weren't approved for Castleman disease that could actually be helpful for me. And, and so that sort of was this like, at least somewhat of an aha moment to be like, alright, well, there are a lot of drugs out there, maybe there's one that could be helpful for me. And so. So that was what got me thinking about it. It wasn't based on any one example. But it was just the conceptual realization, the new drug development was going to be, you know, just too hard and take way too long. So yeah, does that, does that answer the question?

But I don't think that, I think that there's a lot of, I think there's a lot of benefit when there are related diseases, when there's like similarities between, between diseases, as opposed to similarities between the drug being used. So another hyper inflammatory disorder, where mTOR seems to be important, I think we can share and learn more from one another, than the anti aging people. Because, you know, people were using, you know, sirolimus to prevent aging. And, like, I don't know, there's probably some things they can learn from me. Usually, I just tell them like, lower your, lower the dose, don't use our dose is what, and then they asked me about dose, because if you go high dose, you're gonna weaken your immune system. And I don't think that's going to lead you to live longer. I think if you just gave a bunch of high dose sirolimus to a bunch of healthy people, I don't think they would live longer. I think they would die earlier because they would get infections. But, so anyway, that's, that's, that's, I think it's nuanced. And yeah, I love collaboration.

Speaker 1  41:28  
Doesn't mean that it's, exactly, that's exactly right. It could, they could be related, they could be totally unrelated, just because this pathway is important for so much in biology.

So, so like, and I've talked to my friends who are in drug development, and they're like, if someone were to pitch me the idea of blocking mTOR, and I didn't know it jad already been done, I would've been like, Absolutely not like that pathway is too important to life and health, that, like I wouldn't touch it, like that thing would be horrible. But it just so happens that it's probably good enough to block me, but it's not great at blocking it. So there's like still enough of activity. So anyway, for a lot of reasons.

Speaker 1  16:32  
I was really fortunate that I met someone from Pfizer who was in charge of the drug. In charge of Sirolimus at a conference while I was on it, and I, I approached him, and I was like, Hey, I'm on your drug off label, I really want to do a trial. And he was like, Oh, wow, like, you know, we would probably not be interested in providing money for a trial, because, you know, this is a generic drug now. So we don't make any money off of it.

And you know, we're not going to give you any money, we'll give you drug. And then we had another important conversation where he said, Okay, well, if we do this trial, and it's effective. Would you submit this materials to the FDA for a label change? And they had a lot of discussions. And they said, no, they eventually said, No, we will not because it's actually very expensive to them to prepare these materials, it's, the documents of the FDA are like 1000s of pages. So it requires like full time employees working for a pharmaceutical company, putting together 1000 page documents, to be able to submit to the FDA. So it's not feasible, and it's too expensive for the expected return. So they said, Look, we'll give you the drug for trial, but we're not gonna, we're not going to ever submit it to, for FDA approval. And when we learned that that meant that we changed the kind of clinical trial that we did. So if you're doing clinical trial, where the data goes to the FDA, you are required to do it under what's called an IND, investigational new drug application. When you do it under an IND, there are a million rules about how you keep data, how you track data, how you audit data, how you monitor data, the trial becomes extraordinarily complicated, but the FDA will not look at data and less than seven under an IND and all those crazy steps are taken. But once you know that, it's not going to be FDA, you can do it under what's called an IND exemption, which means that you can do a trial, do a really good trial, really rigorous trial. But you don't have to take the 1700 additional steps that are really expensive and time consuming, that just make your trial way, way more expensive. So we apply for an IND exemption, we got it. So we're able to do a clinical trial under IND exemption, which means it's cheaper, faster than under an IND. But it means that the FDA, by definition can never use our data to make a decision on a label change.

So yeah, and also, our understanding of epidemiology of Castleman Disease was poor back then. So from a numbers perspective, I just didn't think that there were enough patients to be able to get like a company interested in developing a new drug from scratch. I mean, now we know that that probably wasn't true. There probably are enough. But anyway, so yes, it was very much, we needed to repur—we needed to find a drug, I didn't know the term repurposing. I didn't know what, uh, like, that wasn't like a term I knew. But it was, it was just that I thought it as two steps. One, we needed to figure out what was happening in my immune system, like what was going on whether it was a defect, or it was a response or result, you know, when you have diseases, something is like, the genesis of that disease. And there's a lot of other stuff that's sort of secondary like, because this part of your body is not working, because this gene is not working other stuff happens. But I just wanted to characterize like what was happening in my immune system. And that would give me like, hopefully a handful of things that maybe you could hit with a drug. And then the idea would be then to back into what drugs exist that like I could hit the things that are happening with no guarantee that the things that are happening are actually like the genesis or the root cause or the therapeutic target. It might just be a phenomenon. But that was the, that was the two step approach. Figure out what's going on. See what drug overlaps.

And then what, if any of value is there, if all of these different organizations that are doing Sirolimus repurposing, of coming together in some sort of like Sirolimus repurposing club of whether it's reaching out to Pfizer together or sharing data or sharing patients. Like should there be more of an effort to gather all of this in one?

Speaker 1  38:30  
Yeah, that's a good question. I think that the fundamental reason that there's probably convergence on Sirolimus is that the mTOR pathway, which is what Sirolimus hits, is really important across like all of biology, in fact, all of life truly, like mTOR is really, really important for integrating a lot of things at once, and in particular, within the immune system. And so, if you're really, really high dose, you really can control hyperactive immune responses. If you go low dose, you can control aspects of metabolism that are related to blood sugar levels, and cholesterol, even aging. So if you treat mice with sirolimus, they live longer, any creature you treat, with Sirolims they live longer, the earlier you start them on, the longer they live. And so it clearly has biological effects that are really important. And so yeah, I think that's probably number one. And then number two, I think that anytime one drug is successful, I think that that can sometimes lead to people liking that drug as being successful. And it's a safe drug. It's been around forever. Very few drugs are used for, in patients for decades. So you don't know like, what happens if I take this drug every day for a decade? Like I have no idea because the trial has never been done. Well, Sirolimus kidney transplantation, by definition as a drug or as a disease or, a situation where you need to be on the drug for a long time. So all of a sudden, there's data on people being on the drug for like 20 and 30 years, and nothing horrible showed up. And so that also makes you feel more comfortable to repurpose a drug if you know that like, hey, if we think this works, we could give it to someone for like 30 years and there's no reason to believe it's gonna cause problems. Whereas there's a lot of drugs where if you give it to someone for 30 years, it cause a lot of problems, or you don't know what's going to happen if you give them the 30 years, so you're afraid to give it to someone for 30 years,",,,,,GENERAL: Sirolimus

No there. No, you know, it's a good question. There aren't as, Sirolimus is cheap. I don't think that in my opinion, in my experience, it's less about whether it's FDA approved, and more about how expensive is it. You know, there's three factors, is it FDA approved? Is it recommended on guidelines? And is it really expensive or not? And it's sort of like a combination of those three, where in my opinion, the expense is actually the number one priority, guidelines is two, and then, and then whether it's FDA approved, I would say is like the third priority in terms of whether you can get access to it.

And so then we did staining on my lymph node tissue for mTOR activation, which confirmed it, so that, you could consider this all preclinical research. And then from right there, the question was, well, mTOR is important. What do you do? It could be? Yeah, so that that's synonymous with preclinical, all that stuff. There would be like, sort of what we mean by preclinical. Exactly.

I think that, to be honest, I think probably number one is lay press. And like my book that led doctors to become aware of it. Like after the New York Times article ran in 2017, we learned about a number of patients that were started on it. And so I think lay press actually maybe more so than others.

Because it's third line along with like seven other things. So it's like the third option, but there's like seven other third options, if that makes sense.

And this is something I did in my role as Chief Scientific Officer of NGLY1.org, while also wearing my academic hat, so I partnered with folks in pharmaceutical chemistry at Utah, to do this one. And it was, it started off really driven by model organisms, and planarian worms in particular, there had been a small set of suspected modifiers for NGLY1 deficiency popping up, mostly ones that are sort of metabolically before or afterwards. And so you know, just by probing planarian worms with RNAi found out that [audio cuts out] the enzyme catabolically, right behind NGLY1 is called ENGase is, in fact, a modifier for the disease, a little bit unexpectedly, it turns out, inhibiting the enzyme improves the planarian worms, in the sense that they, it rescues their very unusual developmental phenotype whereby if you cut them in half, they regrow in both directions. So cutting them in half gives you two planarian worms. But planarian worms with NGLY1 deficiency don't regrow, but planarian worms that have both NGLY1  deficiency and [inaudible] deficiency do. So it's, you know, it's somewhat counterintuitive, but it happens all the time. And what that meant was that ENGase was a target for drug development in NGLY1. And then it pivoted over to computational chemistry, we ended up building structural models of ENGase using homology modeling.

Yeah. I would, I would say, look for places that are translationally minded.

They don't have to be in big institutions, they can appear anywhere at this point. And yeah, I just tell organizations, be careful how much you're investing into basic science. Because, you know, they're, for almost every genetic disease, now, there's a path forward in terms of precision disease modeling, you know, and, and what's amazing is it circumvents tremendous amounts of basic science. So if you just build a model, phenotype it and throw drugs at it, you may never understand why the drug worked. I mean, you really, I can, I can name examples where that's true right now, for stuff we worked on, at UAB. So a couple of weeks ago, we did a drug screen for a disorder called MAPK8IP3, and did it in zebrafish. They've been debating what this gene does for two, three years, four years. I mean, it just, it goes on and on. We don't know what the mutations are doing, whether it's gain of function or loss function. But we do know that amantadine makes the zebrafish better. And we also know that amantadine makes the primary patient better. So, you know, we could, we could spend another four or five years trying to understand the basic science and still not make any progress on helping the patient. Not saying, it's, you know, it's important if you can resolve some of these key basic science questions that do, you know, does unlock routes to drug development, no question.

And I would say the biggest challenge I had was that most of the academics I've engaged with are very well meaning, but don't actually know how to find drugs or repurpose drugs. You know, they're not, they're very good basic scientists, but they don't understand translational science at all. That's a recurring theme. And so their model of the world is, we'll just keep giving us money, we'll keep investing in the basic understanding of this disease, and then maybe someday a drug will pop out. That's just not really how it happens. I guess the most jarring example of this is Epalrestat. So PMM2 is probably the oldest CDG there is, and it's been known for decades, well studied for decades, you probably have 10s of millions of dollars invested in basic research on, you know, that one mechanism, and no drugs came out of it, not one. And then one family puts up $100,000 to do a repurposing drug screen and gets a hit right out of the gate. And I think about that a lot, actually, because there's no reason that screen couldn't have been done much, much, much earlier, much earlier. And yet it wasn't done. And part of that is because it doesn't fit the model of how academics think and work. So how they're funded you, there you don't, you can't go get an R01 off of, you know, a repurposing screen, that doesn't, that doesn't happen. And so it's not necessarily the fault of the academics per se, because, you know, they don't know what they don't know, and they're not funded for it even when they do know it.

And so they can only do what they can get funding to do. And if funding just isn't there, to do a patient's need, then they're just not going to do it, they can't do it. I think what frustrates me is that when patient groups do show up with money, it's not NIH dollars, and then the academics still do what they were going to do anyway. So that's what bothers me is when, you know, limited resources do become available, but it doesn't change their behavior. And then again, mostly, it's out of ignorance, not a any sense of malice.

So the whole idea was how can we bring drugs to the clinic that actually have shown value in a preclinical model. So rather than saying, Oh, this looks cool, let's try it on a patient, actually doing the necessary preclinical work to bring the best drugs to the patient. So that was initiated in 2008. With about five labs, who would together select certain drugs, then test them in their preclinical model and bring them to the clinic. So that was kind of the first attempt to look at drugs for NF repositions,  repurposed, or anything in clinical developed anywhere, right. So no, no specific categorization, just drugs that makes sense for NF. That has then, those drugs were brought to the Clinical Trials Consortium ...And in fact, I joined the foundation in 2012, in 2011, beginning 2012. And in fact, we, we started looking at, can we use a shelf drugs, actually, with the whole Pfizer story, which was around 2015, I want to say, because then Springworks, was created in 2017, I want to, I want to say that around 2015, that we really started to become interested. And then in 18, there was a meeting at the Milken Institute to really talk about this success story. And there is where we launched, in fact, the collaboration between the three organizations for this bridge initiative to really look at, because what we learned, and I can send you the paper, we wrote about that, because then we had a lot of learnings from that Springworks experiment, because a lot of these companies, of course, if you stop a project, the project teams dissemble, people go do other stuff, and nobody has time to go back to that old project that nobody is interested in anymore. The second, if you put a drug on the shelf, somebody has decided to put that drug on the shelf and not develop it. So a lot of millions of dollars that were trashed by doing so. So that asset stinks a little bit, right. So people don't really want to look at that asset anymore. There's a lot bad, bad memory, but the data is often a little bit everywhere. So where, where is the comprehensive data package? Nobody knows. Unless it is put on the out licensing shelf. And then the ones that do the out licensing have to figure it out. But I always say that a lot of these shelved assets are a little bit sent to the graveyard of out licensing. So they are, they're not trashed. When you talk about them, they say no, no, they're up for out licensing. But in fact, you're not, they're just there, and they die little by little, because every month you wait for getting them out there, you lose a month on your patent life.

It's all hard. So that's the scientists in the academic space, who on top of that needs to publish in order to survive, needs to publish innovation to survive. So drug testing is not innovation.

Anyhow, the idea is that those are drugs that go to the target and have this little atomic bomb attached to it through an arm, and they in fact, they, so you bring products, so you bring the drug to the binding of the protein, and then it explodes the, the targets. So that's one of the things we're looking at, we're also looking at the opposite, which is when you, you stabilize, so sometimes diseases are caused by early degradation of the, of the right proteins. So we're also looking at those molecules that bind to the target and then stabilize them that they're not recognized anymore by the degrading system. So we're kind of looking at those new new chemical modalities. But yeah.

They had to do a transcriptomic proteomic study to actually figure out that this molecule was of course hitting out, but also hitting other mechanisms that were super relevant for NF too. So that, what happened then is they said, Okay, this drug apparently has value across all models. So this is really a molecule that we cannot ignore, even if it's approved for a completely different mechanism. It was brought to the, then we build together with MGH and Takeda honestly, a platform trial called INTUITT. And that drug is now in the platform trial, which are six sites across the US and they're running that drug through this multi tumor, multi site trial. And we do start seeing some value of this drug, is it valuable across all manifestations? We don't know yet. But we do definitely some value, but that isn't, it's an, I think it's an interesting story. Because we, we tend to think that if a molecule is approved for a certain mechanism, and that mechanism doesn't make sense to the biology of what we're looking at, we tend to ignore those molecules. And what we really learned through that experiment is don't, because all these kinase inhibitors, they hit one kinase that they marketed for, but there is 75 other kinases that are hit. And maybe the kinase of interest is maybe in that pool of side effects, let's say, but it could be a really valuable drug for that community.

The, so we have in our sector called Neurofibromatosis is a, NF1 is a RAS signaling pathway disorder. So there is a lot of drugs from the RAS signaling pathway we could, or could actually benefit our NF patients.

So they got the drug approval in 2020, drug's called koselugo. And we also helped fund and helped on that path to this drug approval. However, there were a lot of other companies like Pfizer who had also a MEK inhibitor, and it said, like guys, we can't win this game, there is already a drug. This is a rare disorder, chuck on the shelf. So we went to talk to the chief medical officer and the head of Pfizer Cures at that time.

Well MEK was identified as a potential molecular mechanism downstream of the NF1 just because of the biology of N1. Right. What happened then is very early. In fact, with the investment of the Children's Tumor Foundation, this whole thing is mainly the preclinical consortium, where they tested multiple drugs throughout the time, different MEK inhibitors in their animal models, and some of them showed real benefits. So it was in fact, the concept was demonstrated that inhibiting MEK would shrink plexiform neurofibromas, would shrink the tumors that matter to neurofibromatosis type one. Okay. So maybe before again, because just for you to know. Oh, okay, sorry. No, that's okay. I don't have it, doesn't matter, oh so this is the bridge but Okay, let's go back to the, I can send you this presentation. So the, so that was discovered early on between the NIH and the Children's Tumor Foundation was discovered that in fact MEK mattered to tumors, or in fact inhibiting make was a good thing. And then we have been on a path of multiple drugs through the preclinical consortium, multiple investments also made by the National Institute of Health, multiple investments made by the CDMRP, the congressionally directed medical research programs, so people would would send their applications to these different funders. And we as funders would look together at who is funding exactly what, then in the clinical space we, we brought this, we helped, in fact, in this big bubble is in fact, your preclinical consortium, I'm sorry. So this is in fact, where we made big investments, in 2010 and 2015. So those are big investments, multi year investments that we're making through, throughout time. And then the drug testing would happen. And then in fact, what you see also is that the congressionally directed medical research programs, the big blue bubbles are in fact, the Clinical Trials Consortium. So we would have the pre clinicians that would do the work at C—, funded by CTF and the clinicians would start testing drugs in the clinic. And then in fact, as of 2000, what is that, 2012, 2013, that is where the NCI really massively invested in getting this drug approved for neurofibromatosis. So the cool thing here is that we started really talking to each other, let's say in 2012, before that everybody was funding their stuff, because you get these applications and you fund them. And where we have seen huge value is in having these funders come together and say, What are you funding? So what are we funding? Right? And I think this is, this has advanced enormously.

We invited the head of Pfizer cures to the NF Conference, which was like two months later, she came was completely blown away by the quality of the science that was done within the NF community and said, I have the impression of sitting in an Pfizer portfolio meeting because there was a lot of Pfizer guards that were reported on because of the, because of the nature of NF. And she said I'm with you guys. So what you need is a champion. So Lara Sullivan, she said I'm with you guys, I'm going to fight for this, Freda Lewis-Hall who was at that time the Chief Medical Officer of Pfizer said I'm with you guys, I'm going to fight for this and that's how this happened.

Chordoma.txt,,,,"Okay, here's one, one, maybe one key thought, which is that this all comes down to economics. It's not about, no one's bias against rare disease, like, in fact, there's a massive bias in favor of rare disease, people want to give rare disease the leg up. It's purely for companies, it's just purely economics, they have to invest in things that are profitable, otherwise, they'd go out of business like, and to expect them to do otherwise is just totally foolhardy. So if you're a rare disease organization, your job is to make the development of drugs for your disease profitable. And then it will happen, like it's just, and so like, if we can demonstrate that there is an opportunity for companies to make money in Chordoma, then, you know, maybe they've just got like, okay, maybe they, they are such a large company, they have so many fish to fry, they just can't be bothered, in which case, even if it is profitable, maybe it's impossible. And that's a real shame. But even in that instance, I have to imagine that there is a way to like, to raise money to extract the drug from the company, or at least, like have like, finance, excuse me. You know, either preclinical or clinical development of, of that drug for, for the rare diseases, it might be a matter of raising money, but, like I, we've yet to encounter any obstruction or any bias against rare disease within the pharmaceutical industry. And it's just a matter of figuring out, like, what drives their decision making, and then positioning opportunities to be favorable to the incentive structure within which they operate.

It sounds like providing data is also very important.

Speaker 1  1:08:22  
It's huge, like, oh my gosh, like, okay, let's say we had gone to a company that had one of these drugs, and said, Hey, we think Chordoma is really interesting. We've got this in vitro data, would you, can you test your drug in Chordoma models? Well, it would have been, I mean, the answer is 100% no, because even to be able to do that is such a massive investment of time and effort. And it's totally outside their sweet spot. Like, there's just no way they're going to say yes to that. So the only way to get that done is to be able to hand it to them on a plate. And like just do it for them. So if, I guess, if other people are running into resistance from companies, it's almost certainly because what is being asked of the company is impractical, or is just difficult, costly, time consuming, whatever, not within the sweet spot of the company. So I guess the key question becomes how do you get that work done in some other context and generate the data that ultimately the company needs to be able to make a go no go decision.

The biggest thing is set up centralized research capabilities, so that you don't have to continually find academics to recreate the same capabilities over and over and over and over again. So the 70 drugs that we've tested, are in mouse models, that's in the context of, that was in a contract lab. So single contract lab, we only, you know, you, you pay once to set up, like, establish the capability and then thereafter, you're only paying the cost of the experiment. So if you do this in an academic lab, they have to import the models, they have to hire someone, it takes, like for a PDX study, it takes a year really before to go from a standing start to actually running PDX studies, it's like a year because it's a slow growing model. So it's a year that you're having to pay someone. And not only that, but like, unless you're a lab that really specializes in this, like they're having, there's so much they're having to learn. So it's just like, it's so inefficient. To do this at a small scale at an academic institution, you've got to achieve scale. So the first thing we did, we like, we attacked was in vivo experiments, because that was the biggest bottleneck. And that was like, the greatest inefficiency in academia. Now, our lab that we've just set up, is aiming to address, like, bring the same economies of scale, the same efficiency, the same increase in feasibility to in vivo, excuse me, in vitro studies. So I think, I think every disease needs a set of core labs that are outside of academia and industry. And, you know, maybe there's different ways that that can be done. But I think patient organizations are always a really good home for those, because we have an incentive, like our, our sole incentive is to bring treatments to patients as quickly as possible. And when that is your incentive, it drives a different set of behavior, in particular, around data sharing, around collaboration, around working with a sense of urgency, and, you know, like, I mean, it's just like, it's, it's mind boggling to know how old and stale everything the literature, all the data in the literature is, like everything in the literature that you see, I mean, I'm sure you're aware of this, is at minimum, two or three years old. And more likely, especially in the case of rare diseases, when you know, there isn't necessarily huge, like competition and large well resourced labs, I mean, the average for us is probably like, five to seven years. I mean I hate to say it, it's like, it's embarrassing. It's just five to seven years where the world is, is locked out of the latest knowledge, or it's hidden from you. And, you know, researchers are unable to generate hypotheses based upon it. Subsequent experiments go undone, subsequent discoveries go unmade. And when you've got a research done in the context of a patient organization, like, we have no need to fill in the data, we can just give it away immediately. So if you go to our website, look at our drug screening program, much, many of the drugs that have been tested, the data is just out there on fixture for anyone to look at. And we put it out there in as close to real time as we can.

And so, this was like, the, the concept or the, um, the concept came from, I guess, a big team effort, I guess you could say it probably was first identified by a lab in Germany. But then, a different lab, or excuse me, a different investigator at Mass General who's on a medical advisory board kind of took that discovery and recognized that there was a different class of drugs than the the Germans had identified, that could potentially be relevant.

So these were like compounds that GSK had created that were not patented, they were sharing them with academic investigators. And so that screen also turned up EGFR inhibitors as like one of the most active compound classes. In fact, I should say, we've probably, it probably been a half dozen or more, maybe even, maybe eight or ten different, like compound screens that were enriched for either approved drugs or druggable targets.

It's been done at the Broad with their, at the repurposing hub, which is 6000. The Broad also did a smaller screen of about 400. Nerviano, I think that was a few hundred.

Chordoma.txt,,,,"Yeah, sure. I don't know that I've actually, I listed it. So this is, this. This did not come out of, you know, any sort of preclinical work. So basically, the story here is that all, like everything we've done to understand the biology of the disease has basically been unbiased. So it's been whole genome sequencing, or epi genomic analysis, or these unbiased drug screens, or CRISPR screens to identify genetic eventualities in Chordoma. And so we've just like let these unbiased screens point us to the most important targets. Well, anyway, the, the most important target that's been identified the one that is like consistently identified as like a key driver and greatest vulnerability in Chordoma is a currently undruggable target called Brachyury. It's a transcription factor. There are no drugs that directly target it. However. However, there are kind of interesting happenstance at around the same time that this target was being like, identified as a key driver of Chordoma, there was also a group at the National Cancer Institute that found that it was expressed in a number of other malignancies, a number of other solid tumors, and associated with metastasis, with resistance to therapy, with poor prognosis, etc. And so, this and moreover, that it was tumor specific, it's not expressed in any normal tissues. They were really excited about this. They're an immunology group and said, wow we've got this tumor specific antigen, or tumor specific target. Let's develop a immunotherapy against it. Because you would expect there'd be no off target effects. So they actually this group at the NCI they developed several different Brachyury-targeted vaccines and then they worked with a couple of different companies to develop and commercialize those vaccines. Initially, initially, not with the intent of going after Chordoma, but I happened to be at the time on it was called the DCLG, the Directors Consumer Liaison Group for the National Cancer Institute, which is basically like, it's now called CORA, the Council of Research Advocates, I believe, but basically, it was a way of connecting NCI with patient groups and vice versa. And in 2010 I believe, just so happened that one of the investigators that spoke to our DCLG group was a, was a young investigator there named Chris Herie, who was involved in a clinical trial with Brachyury vaccine. And afterwards, I went up to him and like, you know, cornered him and we ended up having like an hour long conversation at the Clinical Center at the NCI about how much it made sense to include Chordoma patients. And anyway, Chris was convinced and, and then ultimately was able to convince his, his chief, and I believe the company as well. Yeah, actually the company. So at this point, it was what company was that? It was, it was called GlobeImmune. They, well, so I think initially, if I'm remembering, if I have my sequence of events here correctly, I think the NCI just included, the NCI included, because it was a trial that was run at the NCI, they added an expansion cohort of I think it was like 10 or 11 Chordoma patients. We got the word out to the Chordoma patient community, and they weren't completely blown away, because within like a week, they had their trial filled and they've never seen anything like this. So they were, they got really excited. Amazingly, they saw in this expansion cohort, they saw a couple responses, one pretty significant response and a couple like minor responses. And then based upon that, the company GlobeImmune that they were working with got interested and, and we worked with them to design a phase two trial in Chordoma that was ultimately run at the NCI. And this is, like, we had a lot of back and forth. Second, we had a lot of, a lot of involvement with them in trial design, and actually just sat in on a meeting that they had with the FDA and like, I think in the end, like steered them towards a trial design that helped them accrue patients. And then, anyway, that, that particular Brachyury drug, or Brachyury vaccine, excuse me, has ended up not being commercialized. And that's largely because the company ran out of money. But, and also, I think it was probably not the ideal vaccine platform. But now, the NCI has worked with another company with a different vaccine platform called Bavarian Nordic. And they have run now, three different clinical trials, all, including Chordoma patients. And our role has been simply to help them while we've reviewed their trial concept with our medical advisory board, provide feedback, and then help them recruit patients for those trials. And it's been interesting, because all three of these trials, in every single trial, there's been some evidence of activity, but it's not been sufficient to, like meet the predefined endpoints that were, um, so none of the trials actually were technically a success. But on the other hand, they were enough, there was enough interesting signal there that the company has been willing to continue investing in additional trials. And so there's, there's the final one, probably the final one, I can't imagine they're gonna do any more after this. But probably the final one is ongoing right now. So hopefully, we'll know soon whether it is indeed efficacious. But yeah, that was an example of, you know, these, none of these vaccines are approved. They're all like, very early, and the hope was that Chordoma could be a registration indication for them.

Ania K  38:49  
And there's no way to have this off label, right? Because it's a vaccine, like if it's a drug' not approved, and it's kind of out there.

But a vaccine, it's a difficult different kind of worms, I assume.",,,,,"GENERAL: Different types of repurposing,GENERAL: Focus on not yet approved drugs"
Chordoma.txt,,,,"tory. And then another example is here we have, okay, so there was a chemical screen that was done at UNC. They, they found, okay, so there was also a screen done in the University of Michigan. A lot of these screens have been done. Because the one in University of Michigan, they identified a class of drugs called PI3 kinase inhibitors, or dual PI3 kinase mTOR inhibitors as being active in Chordoma cells, which, by the way, also the NCATS group identified. So there's like, you know, like they're converging on a similar set of targets. So we tested on behalf of the Michigan group, we tested their, their nominated PI3 kinase inhibitor in PDX models. And it was kind of had like middling activity, wasn't really anything like super interesting. So we kind of shelved it because this compound class has historically been very disappointing in the clinic for cancer, at least,  [inaudible] lots of toxicity, underwhelming efficacy. So we had, we had shelved this concept, but then the UNC team did a screen and it also led them to duall PI3 kinase mTOR inhibitors, including the one that Michigan, but also they found one that was not, and by the way, the one at Michigan was a, that's an approved drug. But the UNC team included some experimental compounds that are not approved. And they found one that seems to be like, head and shoulders above the rest. And that it happened to be owned by, interestingly, it was invented at UNC and then it was spun out to a company. And, and so they hooked us up with the company.

It's not about, no one's bias against rare disease, like, in fact, there's a massive bias in favor of rare disease, people want to give rare disease the leg up. It's purely for companies, it's just purely economics, they have to invest in things that are profitable, otherwise, they'd go out of business like, and to expect them to do otherwise is just totally foolhardy. So if you're a rare disease organization, your job is to make the development of drugs for your disease profitable. And then it will happen, like it's just, and so like, if we can demonstrate that there is an opportunity for companies to make money in Chordoma, then, you know, maybe they've just got like, okay, maybe they, they are such a large company, they have so many fish to fry, they just can't be bothered, in which case, even if it is profitable, maybe it's impossible.

Started as I said, like, repurposing is not an initiative of ours, it's just like, it's the whole shebang, it's like, everything is, is just, is going where the science leads us, and it happens to lead to repurposing. And so in order to do anything, we had to have tumor tissue, and cell lines, and animal models. And until those things existed, like very little could be done, our hands were tied. And so that was like, that was a big challenge, not just for repurposing, but for Chordoma research, writ large. And one of the most important things we had to do first was solve that by developing models, by validating models, by centralizing them into repositories, making them easily accessible. So I think that that is something that probably needs to be done for every single disease. And it's not just for repurposing. It has to be done for repurposing, but it also has to be done for every other aspect of discovery and translational research in, in that disease as well. So I don't know, at that phase that was a big one. I mean, in all honesty, nothing that we've talked about here is like, tremendously interesting or sophisticated from a scientific perspective. It's like, very mundane stuff, like you test drugs in cells. You identify drugs that like, are active in cells, and we tested them in mice. And oh, by the way, like, I guess there was also some, some nice molecular work that was done. But this is not like, this is not like super interesting, or like cutting edge science. It's like very, very simple. And it's all just blocking and tackling and like logistics.

So you mentioned to me with academia, you know like the speed of it, the lack of interest and everything. So you've kind of solved that with, with setting up your own lab and like with logistics, like oh, we mentioned of the, like, didn't have cell lines, so you developed cell lines. So there's, I guess there's challenges but it doesn't seem like there's been like fatal roadblocks that at least they couldn't, or are not working on right now.

And you are seeing promising results from the off label use as well, because I'm assuming you're, you're tracking that, in addition to clinical trials and everything.

Speaker 1  43:00  
Okay, so how do we track that. We have an internal like anecdotal response list basically, like, I mean, it's very low tech, it's just when we hear about a response, we write it down. But honestly, it's purely for hypothesis generating purposes, we're not actually trying to quantify. And then there's a natural history study going on at the National Cancer Institute. And the hope is that patients enroll in that. I think, again, it's probably not a wide enough cross section of the patient population to, I mean, to do anything other than generate hypotheses. I think our view is that, like, we should cast like a wide net for identifying anecdotal responses, use those hypotheses generated to be tested and put in trials, excuse me. But we do not have a mechanism in place like CDCN, or, you know like, like Dave's registry, for example, where we're getting like a large cross section of the patient population. And we've looked into this a lot. I'm not 100%. I mean, I think with enough resources, we could do it. But we don't have the level of resources on an ongoing basis to be able to do it with a level of rigor that I think would be needed to truly generate real world data that was like, comparable to or even, like, comparable to clinical trial results or even useful. So I think like, if we're going to try to base, like, if we're going to try to generate real, real world data, like it has to, has to be like, from a broad enough cross section of the patient population has to be like, rigorous, etc. And that just takes a level of resource that we haven't had.",,,,,Org Support: off label use tracking
Chordoma.txt,,,,"nd we agreed, because the in vitro efficacy was so much superior, we agreed to test their drug on an in-kind basis in the models. And indeed, the in vivo efficacy was superior. This was just submitted or it was just presented at AACR at an abstract at AACR. And so now the company is, they're a very small company and they're looking for registration indication for the drug. They don't even, like they're. They are pre IND. So like they're about to file an IND and they are thinking they would apply for you know, submit their IND for Chordoma. So anyway, I guess we're now really, because we've become really interested in the target. But we're not 100% convinced yet that there's is actually best in class. And so now what we're doing is comparing their drug head to head with all the other dual PI3 kinase mTOR inhibitors that are in clinical development. And we're doing that through Chordoma Foundation labs, like, we were able to do it very, very quickly. So this is ongoing experiment, it's happening right now.

So if this company's drug is superior then, okay, we'll try to work with them. But if it turns out that it's either equivalent to or inferior to a drug that is already in clinical development, it makes more sense for us to go that path because it's, could be easier. If it's more likely, less risky and faster to get to patients. So, you know, there, I think there's more uncertainty, will this company, will the small company raise money to be able to run the trial, who knows, will, you know, will we even want to work with them?

Now, one of the companies, was, basically they're a very large pharmaceutical company, and they're never going to start a trial for Chordoma patients, however, they happenstancely, they just recently amended one of their ongoing trial protocols, such that it would actually be, Chordoma patients would actually be eligible.

Chordoma.txt,,,,"I think the premise of like a repurposing project is, is not actually, that's just actually not even a concept that we've really thought. Like, that's not, that's just not a concept that we've like really, has been relevant to us. Like basically, from the, from the outset. Like, we've known that there either two paths, two treatments for this disease, like it's all just about finding treatments for the disease. And there's two paths, it's either finding an existing drug or its, if necessary, developing a new drug. But honestly, developing a new drug is such a massive and onerous undertaking, we don't, like, if at all possible, we'd like to try to avoid it. So like, the vast majority of everything that we've done to date, and everything, probably that we will do in the future is all about repurposing. It's not as though repurposing is like some small side thing. It's like, it's the whole thing. It's just everything. And it's it's not something that is different, or special, or like a sub component of it, it's just like, it's the whole thing, and we don't have a particular bias or predilection at the outset, for repurposing versus new drug, it's just wherever the biology leads us, it's either going to lead to a drug that happens to be, you know, a target that happens to be druggable, in which case, it's going to be repurposing, or it's going to lead to a target that's not druggable, in which case, we're gonna have to determine whether it's worth investing in new drug discovery. And if so, then, you know, that's, it's kind of it's separate, separate entity, or a separate, you know, project or workflow. So anyway, I guess all that is to say, what I would, I would say, this whole, this whole process that you're describing is not just unique to repurposing, it's like the entire process of finding a new treatment for a disease. So all the prep work was everything we had to do to even enable research on the disease. So it was developing models, it was creating repositories of models, it was developing a biobank, it was recruiting researchers into the field, it was connecting them via research conferences, it was brokering collaborations between them, it was organizing the patient communities so that we could ultimately run clinical trials, like all of those things go into even being able to do research on the disease. And the first step then is, is, is taking an unbiased view of like, what are the operative like biological programs or phenomenon, in, in these cells that are driving them and, what, which of them are targetable and, and then that can point hopefully to existing drugs.

Chordoma.txt,,,,"And so, this was like, the, the concept or the, um, the concept came from, I guess, a big team effort, I guess you could say it probably was first identified by a lab in Germany. But then, a different lab, or excuse me, a different investigator at Mass General who's on a medical advisory board kind of took that discovery and recognized that there was a different class of drugs than the the Germans had identified, that could potentially be relevant. And he had the connection, his medical oncologist had a connection with the, with this drug company.

And there wasn't, they had no way to fill that gap. So, Chordoma Foundation stepped in and provided a grant to fill that, that gap. So I think in the end, it was like the company provided $600,000, we provided $300,000 or something like that.

But because we, we had observed that this was kind of a missing link in putting together data packages to justify clinical trials, we had over the previous couple of years built, well, first of all, supported the development of PDX models, and then built a repository of PDX models and then built a drug screening program to be able to, through a contract lab test, on demand, any drug we wanted in those models. So we actually, we did that. We tested several different EGFR inhibitors head to head in the, in the models.

So the, I mean, it was a stepwise process, like some of the initial rationale from the group in London was published, I want to say all the way back in 2010, or maybe even 2009. Oh, actually, I should mention. Now that I'm remembering, and I'm trying to remember the the timelines here. So okay, so part of, part of what got the UK group in, part of, part of the data package was their like molecular pathology, which I think was published in 2009, or 2010. They also did a chemical screen and their chemical screen was done in partnership with GSK. And that was a relationship that we had set up. They we connected them at one of our research workshops. And, and that, and GSK provided a number of compounds through what they called the PKIS: the Published Kinase Inhibitor Set. So these were like compounds that GSK had created that were not patented, they were sharing them with academic investigators. And so that screen also turned up EGFR inhibitors as like one of the most active compound classes. In fact, I should say, we've probably, it probably been a half dozen or more, maybe even, maybe eight or ten different, like compound screens that were enriched for either approved drugs or druggable targets. And all of them have turned up EGFR inhibitors as like, the, among or the most active compound class. So like, it's just a very obvious low hanging fruit scenario here. And it, you know, just so happened that it was like these three groups all submitted concepts, clinical trial concepts around the same time, but to be honest, if they didn't, someone else would have like it was just, it needed to be done. And in fact, I guess relatedly so the Cetuximab trial is kind of built upon the same data package. But why is Cetuximab in addition to Afatinib because they're both EGFR inhibitors Well. Again, among the EGFR inhibitors that we tested in vivo, Cetuximab and Afatinib were the ones that were the most active, they were like equivalently, it had equivalent activity. But Cetuximab is an antibody, Afatinib is a small molecule and moreover, Cetuximab has the ability to, in addition to block, to acting via EGFR inhibition also has the ability to, potentially to mediate a, an immune response. So it's called ADCC: antibody  dependent cellular cytotoxicity, I think is, the, what that stands for. But anyway, it's an NK mediated cell killing that is stimulated by the presence of Cetuximab bound to the tumour cell. So, the hope was that you could perhaps drive enhanced efficacy via this one-two punch of blocking signaling in the immune response. Also, you know, there's, you know, that potentially resistance can emerge to one EGFR inhibitor like to, you know, tyrosine kinase inhibitor like Afatinib, and perhaps that can be, sensitivity can be restored via the syntax map if that pans out.",,,,,GENERAL: Date of project initiation

And because this mutation is common in cancer, they really thought that they should also have a 20% reduction in mass endpoint. And that is not something that is easy to measure in our condition.

Speaker 1  39:44  
Compassionate use was pretty easy. Once like once, so I think in the very early days so like 2019, there was a little bit more hoops to jump through. But once they had like many, many quotes patients on it, it was a quicker process. So I know when we applied for Riley, it took us about six months to get approved, but she also has type one diabetes. And so that was, this drug increases blood sugar. And so we had more hoops to jump through. But then like late, you know, a year later, people were saying it was taking about a month to six weeks to get approved for managed access. So was the question, is FDA approval a bad thing? Or, um, I think that's a really tricky. I. So I think one of my worries was that with FDA approval, we would have less interest from other pharma companies. But I think, in talking to partners and colleagues who have had the FDA approval, it sounds like that will not be the case, there will probably be more interest. And I think like, as long as people are really like looking at the real world data, that it's not a homerun for everybody. I mean, I, we need a big bucket of drugs for people because this disease is so complicated, and one drug is not going to work for everyone. So I don't, I don't, I don't think it was a bad thing. I think it's, I think it's complicated. And I think families are, you know, it's one more thing that families have to navigate now is like moving off of this and getting their insurance to cover it, or Novartis to help with the, with paying with the copay and all that.

Speaker 1  1:04  
So in 2012, so CLOVES has a label that came to be in 2009. So it's a relatively new label. And in 2012, when some of our researchers discovered the genetic mutation, which is in PIK3CA, PIK3CA is common in aggressive cancers. And so I think at that point, you know, the global, we started thinking like, oh, potentially, there are some other like oncologic agents that may be able to slow down our disease progression. So I think that was like the first moment. But that was also when we were a very new organization. And we weren't focused on research. And so I think after that, I think probably what happened next was that in 2018, there was a French doctor who tried a PIK3CA inhibitor out in 18 people in France under Managed Access, and had some success.

And I did not get to, like I did not get to weigh in on the placebo arm. Because that was the medical team really wanted a placebo arm and our folks are usually sick enough that they don't want to risk, like so maybe they're on Sirolimus, they would need to wash out Sirolimus before starting phase two trial, and they might get no med.

Some of them were restricted. But in the last couple of years, I think we have two projects that were funded to look for those drugs. So we are starting to see some of the preliminary results of those. But when I started with the Foundation Building Strength, they were really were funding one project, studying 1,400 different FDA drugs in fish model and the, there was a two year project, and they had some good results. They had like 20 lead compounds that they apply for a second grant. And I was part of, I was involved in granting that, in funding that, that proposal.

So I think they, they started testing this drug because there was some intention that this drug could potentially be a possibility for this group of diseases. And as they hypothesize that things were going in that direction, they got some good results in the animal models. And the company was already licensing the drug for Duchenne. And so they decided also to test it in congenital muscular dystrophies. The group at the NIH, the group in Switzerland, they were one of the, I mean, one of the main, probably the main researcher in in that subtype of the disease, the LAMA2 gene. And he had a very good connections with the NIH team that also worked in that specific subtype and another subtype that is Collagen 6. And so, they because the common mechanism of Apoptosis is the one that they think is behind the, the death of the muscle fibers. They thought, okay, maybe it could work for both drugs. So the group working in Collagen 6 at the NIH, and another group working in Italy, with Collagen 6, and this group from Switzerland working on LAMA2, the other subtype. They all agree that this this drug could be tested in humans and probably be the leader in the, in this group of diseases.

Yes, I'm actually um, I'm especially, from my point of view, I prefer rational approach to treatments for this particular type of diseases. I'm not totally happy with drug repurposing. In my short experience with that, I'm a researcher myself, I worked 27 years at the bench. And yeah, I'm biased of course, in, in my case, I prefer designed treatment with a hypothesis and no, not, not just fishing for, for the drug. But I understand and I understand the goods of drug repurposing and especially for, for many disorders not especially for, for this very complex genetic and very grave. Very, very, very I don't get very, very strong phenotype diseases. I understand that for cancers. I understand that for, for many other diseases. I mean, still for our group of diseases, as it was the case of Omigapil, for some particular symptoms, maybe you can get a drug repurposed for that. But of course, I'm 99.9% sure in my beliefs that no drug would be curative for these diseases, genetically nourishing and produce, produce these very hard phenotypes. So yeah, we are doing gene therapies, classical and some of the new ones with CRISPR or oligo - oligo antisense. Yeah, I mean, we are, we fund projects, right, we are not do, whereas we are a small foundation, our budget is small, so, we kind of gave seed funding for projects. We have made a good impact.

Yeah, so I mean, we are open and we think that we need to be opportunistic and we can not, we don't want to, I mean, we don't want to marry only one type of approach to therapies. We want to be diverse and, and also because I mean, the spectrum of the phenotype in the disease is wide, is huge even with the same gene mutation to patients have different progress of the disease?

And we have to, we have a bigger strong community of young adults and adults that they need a different solution.

So don't ever give up and definitely use the patient voice, like everybody thinks, you know, even I was amazed when I saw the FDA, the pharmaceutical companies, the doctors, the researchers, literally in tears when the patients were telling their stories, and everybody needs motivation for their job, no matter what you do, you need, you need to be praised for your work, you need motivation. So go out there. And, you know, I think that us going to talk to the pharmaceutical companies really made a difference. And I feel like us sharing our stories, the patients' stories with all these people, and you know, you're not just, you're not just a 15 minute office visit. I mean, there's so much more that goes beyond what the doctors hear and know and listen to and see. And, you know, they tell you, Okay, remove all food, you know, I don't think your daughter is going to be able to drink the formula, she'll probably need a feeding tube. And, you know what, we worked on, and I sat at the kitchen table with my daughter sobbing, and I sat with her when she threw herself on the kitchen floor and told me I was killing her because I wasn't allowing her to eat anymore. And, you know, like, doctors don't realize these things. And when they hear them, it matters, you know, it makes them work harder and makes them you know, the lab workers, if they really get to hear the patients and see the patients and know, there's people behind it. All of that is such a motivation to patients. So, you know, use your voice and be your own advocate, and, you know, reach out to these drug companies, and they listen, like people think I would have never thought they would have listened. I was shocked. But they do, they really listen. And obviously, they have an end goal. And it's money. And it doesn't matter because their end goal is money. Our end goal is they're making a medicine that's going to make our family member whoever have a better quality of life. So like everyone's in business to make money, you know, that's just why people work, but use your voice. So that would be my biggest advice. Don't, don't give up and really share your stories because they, they make a huge difference.",,"- Don't give up

So basically, so when the organization was founded, there was, basically you guys focused on setting up this researcher collaboration, so helped getting this grant and kind of connecting all these researchers and then it doesn't sound like maybe you're, like, involved as much in the actual research, like, you kind of let the researchers kind of do their thing, is is that right? I was thinking levels of involvement.

Speaker 1  17:10  
Well, they have to turn in a grant application. So it has to be on something that we're focusing on, we don't just accept a grant for like, if they want to see what six foods would be most, um, used for causing this disease. Like we don't, we're really focused more on a better treatment or a cure. So we are focusing on, but we don't get in there and give them suggestions. We don't have any that, our doctors that are on our board or on our advisory board, are these doctors doing the research. So we have faith and trust that they're, you know, that they're doing the right thing. And then I started to say we have a conference every other year. Our last one, unfortunately, was 2019, because of COVID. But we do have, like so much industry comes to our conference. It's a real, patient education research conference. So it's researchers, doctors, we had researchers and doctors from 9 countries to 10 in 2019. So they're all sharing their research, you know, they're, different doctors are presenting other doctors are learning. And we've been doing this. I think that was our fifth one every other year.

Speaker 1  1:29  
Well, it was always one of our missions, because when we started the foundation, I actually started the foundation when my daughter was diagnosed, and there was no approved medication or drug for her disease. And at first, they were just kind of throwing out different medications to see if they worked, if they didn't. And she was progressively getting sicker. And it was like, you know, when your life is going, what you think is really good and normal. This is the youngest of three children. I know nothing about chronic illness, I know nothing about rare disease, and then we get this diagnosis. And it's like, how could there be no medications? How could there be no treatment, and I didn't understand, you know, the whole process behind how a researcher even begins research and why the hospital doesn't fund them for research, because I always thought that's the way research worked. So I'd say right off the start, it was always a focus of ours, is that, you know, we wanted a better treatment for the disease, and we wanted to have drug options, to have a better quality of life. Because being told at any age, you can't eat anymore, doesn't make, you know, even if, no matter what, no matter what age you are, like people are like, well, it must be easier because he's never had food before. That must be easier because they can understand they can't have it, you know, there's never been a good age to be told, you can't eat anymore. So it was I would say from the beginning, which was, the organization was started in 2003. That that was a focus of ours. And we, at the time, partnered with Cincinnati Children's Hospital, with a allergist immunologist, who also was a PhD, and backer, and so his focus was definitely on finding a drug. He just had no money for research. So we started funding him and his research. Over the past, now, 19 years, we've funded 10 different hospitals and research centers and over $6 million in research. And obviously, with that, you know, we help recruit for drug trials, we help try and explain to patients, because they have no idea, you know, they have no idea what it takes to, the amount of time like I never thought myself. 19 years, we just got our first drug approved a few weeks ago.

And I think they're still going to work on something they're not ready to give up I don't think, which is wonderful, because I think they have, I think what they're aiming at doing is a little bit different than the other two biologics, and I think that they should continue to do their work, but and then flovent is used for many, many years for asthma.

And you know, the FDA was there. And we had representation from the FDA. And one thing at our conference that we really pride ourselves in is that we don't just want to hear the doctors and the researchers and the industry people talking and the FDA. We want them to also hear what the patient's needs are, what the patient wants, what patient is actually living through living with this disease because you go to an office visit, and you're talking for 10 minutes and they are throwing you out the door. So to actually have somebody representing the patients and telling their story through their timeline. I mean, it was really remarkable. Um, in 2017 and 19, we had the industry people, the FDA just thanking us, they were actually in tears, you know, listening to the patient stories, but just thanking us, because they really believe that, you know, like a child can't really express how serious the disease is and how much these drugs or medications are needed. But to hear the story being described by a parent, the way that they described it, they were like, Yeah, you do know, and this is extremely difficult, or this, you know, this is extremely hard. And even for some of the drug trials, I've been asked to join in on the calls with the FDA, because the FDA, you know, was really strict about making that age 18 for drug trials, and for our disease, because there's so many pediatric patients, and it's so life altering that I mean, they just wouldn't budge under the age of 18, and the doctors and the pharmaceutical company, were really trying hard to get them to go to age 12. And after about a year of struggling, they finally like reached out to our foundation and said to me, can you, you know, we have 15 minutes, this is our last try, they won't hear from us ever again, we either get it or we don't get it. And I really want them to hear, like from a patient and a patient's story, and you talk to so many people. And like they gave me half of the call, we had 15 minutes, they gave me like seven of the minutes to talk and within 20 minutes, they called back and said we're approved for age 12. I mean, I know patients who have attempted suicide, I know patients who I actually know one patient who did commit suicide, it's, it's so life altering to have this disease, and the struggles of just being a teenager in general. I mean, if you're healthy, you know, but forget it, if you're not, you know, that perfect normal, whatever that would be teenager, it's just such a struggle, and it doesn't matter. You know, and people can't see this disease. It's not like you have a rash all over your body or, you know, so they're like, Oh, why can't you come to school every day? And you're not really sick. And why are you, Why do you have a feeding tube in you and, you know, so people are, sometimes aren't very nice, either. So there's bullying that goes along with it. And so I mean, we have a very large patient voice, our, our word goes a long, a long way. When the doctors are starting to do a trial, and they're working on protocol for the trial, they'll reach out to the patient advocacy groups. And they'll say, Do you think that we could get people if we do this, if we do this? If we do this? And we're like, either yes, because that is so needed, and people will understand. Or absolutely not people aren't going to, like, why would they try your drug trial if they can't continue the drug, if they heal, when they can go next door and try that drug? And they're guaranteed the drug until it's FDA approved? I mean, which one would you go? Which trial would you, you know, be part of? So, you know, and patients don't even know to ask those questions. So that is one thing as a patient advocacy group, like you, we have to educate our patient community what to ask before you know before signing up, it's very important to be part of the drug trial. But it's also important to ask the right questions, so that when you're done, you're not shocked that you got the placebo for six months or you know, like you have to be very aware and understand what's going on. And I remember too, one time having a bad argument with a patient, an adult patient. He couldn't understand why he was gonna have to pay for the endoscopy because doctors just get rich off of him anyways, and if you know, whatever research this is, they're just gonna get rich off of their findings. So why does he have to pay for his endoscopy? And I'm like, Well, if the drug company isn't offering to pay for that as part of the trial, and they don't have research dollars to pay for that endoscopy the hospital is going to charge you, the hospital is not going to give you the endoscopy free, it's a surgery room, it's anesthesiology, it's a lot more than the one doctor. You know, and patients just don't understand and patients who really suffer too they start feeling like the world owes them and everybody owes them and kind of like, why aren't they being handed things.

You go through a washout period, and then the people who were on placebo get drug. So it is the early indications for some people. It does work for many people with nosebleeds.

North Carolina opens, they have you know, 700 I mean, they're 1000s of patients, right, that come in on imaging. And so, and they're profit centers, really. And so. We, my advice was, who is engaging with you? Who's attending your meetings? Who was presenting at your conferences? Who, who are helping, write, who do you turn to if you want to do lay summaries of certain trials? You know, who these people are. Some of the, I will say some of the, one of the reasons that we were late to the game in 2010 was the guy that founded us. He uh, he uh, he fought with, I, he fought with me tooth and nail, you're giving chemo to patients, this was Avastin, in, and you shouldn't be doing this clinical, you know, this topical trial. We should be doing this, you know, intervention, Young's procedure, having your nose sewn shut. I said absolutely 100% no. Oh, yeah, that's a, that's a treatment. On the inside, you, you they so it's called Young's procedure. It's ridiculous. Or taking what they what they were doing for 20 years is taking skin from the thigh and putting it in the nose. Guess what happens? You've got to take care of that every day. And the vessels grow around it. So it doesn't, yes. So what I'm saying is, I have a lot of battle scars.

And we did a clinical trial with the six sites. And we looked at, and we worked very closely, we worked with the FDA. We got to, we got these bottles that had to be used, and the drug in the bottle, and what concentration, and they would be applied. So we looked at Bevacizumab, which is another name for Avastin and three other agents versus saline. And the study was completed in two years, it was published and it was, we found that the Bevacizumab topically was not, was just as effective as saline. Two caveats one, we don't think the concentration was high enough. And two, the patients that were using it in the nose topically, were irrigating. And that didn't come out until after, well after the trial. So you, one could argue or think that perhaps the agent wasn't getting to the, the vascular tissue where it needed to be.

Um, gene therapy, it will, will be there in, I'd say, in the more distant future. Okay. And it'll be organ specific.

The brain, the lung, the nose, the GI, the liver. You know, we now think the uterus, I mean, we could go on and on. And so we have to think about that. And, and the, the real problem is, you know, we were formed in 91. And that was great. But we were formed by a doctor, thank goodness who took an interest. He was an interventional radiologist. So all of the treatments are interventional in the nose. They were doing, you know, grafts that were horrendous. They were doing cautery, laser, you name it, it's all interventional. The same thing when you have 50% of our patients have lung, these vascular malformations in the lungs. So you go in with coils and plugs and you go in the artery, well, you know, we want to have drugs that are going to shrink the vessels instead of all of these interventional treatments. So I, drug repurposing is huge, and we're now looking at all the pathways. So Sirolimus, Tacrolimus had an okay response. So we're looking at Sirolimus. But we see now there could be a pick three pathway. So that's why we're looking at that, but we have a very complicated TGF beta pathway. And the other piece to this and I tried to get NCI involved. People with HHT have less cancer. And if we do get cancer, we have a better survival rate.

Take that out of the transcript, but that are needed to move the the other research forward because you need to have access to all the tissues and the tumors and everything that we just don't have good access to right now.

Ania K  33:48  
Makes sense. With organizations, I guess moving towards like, learnings from this. I think there are a lot of organizations are having those kinds of problems of silos and researcher collaboration. So what would you kind of advise other organizations that are in those kind of similar situations of like, how do you either establish the collaboration, collaborations in a way that like that they have to share, you know, if they're going to work with you, or like, if it's an ongoing collaboration? How do you kind of encourage. Can you just talk a little bit more about that?

Speaker 1  34:24  
Yeah, I know a lot of it. I wish I had some perfected lists of steps, but a lot of it is just knowing people well, and knowing what their strengths are and egos and just paying careful attention to that and working with them one on one, getting them to be in more meetings with you initially. And then really encouraging them to do collaborative projects where their funding is actually integrated. That helps a lot. So when we started the Stand Up to Cancer team, for example, prior to that, we had never funded a team of researchers and so. Unfortunately, I think a lot of researchers follow the money. So if you say, say the mandate, you need to work together or you don't get funding, then they just start doing that. It's it's just as simple as it is. But on a more humanistic level, I think it's also just making sure people have a voice and a place at the table. And that can be kind of difficult when you're dealing with scientists, obviously. But I think just, I think what we've done is just kind of work as an intermediary. So we have a lot of mandates. And it's also about holding up a certain level of excellence. And so they see your foundation as something that's a guiding light, as opposed to why are we dealing with those people. So, these people, so on different levels, I think it's just mandating collaboration, mandating, sharing, and any of the contracts that you have with the universities, and then really catering to relationship building. So spending time learning about the investigators, and like I said, what their strengths are, because each PI brings a unique angle to it. And they just don't necessarily see that. And so they also have to understand that this is going to benefit their career, because we're working on more publications, and sometimes it's hard for them to see that. And I think the biggest issue like, like I said earlier, it's just who has access to tissues and everything like that. But once you establish it in a way where the community knows who has all the resources, and then you continually say they're not sharing, then you can call them out on it and say, Okay, you're not sharing and XYZ number people have told me this. So accountability would probably be the last step. So it's not easy, but I think it's doable. And another thing too, is patients. So you have to use the patients to really push them. So we hold a big scientific conference every year, except for the last two years. It was virtual. But what's great about it is we hold it concomitantly with our adult retreat. So about 60 adults with Fanconi Anemia come, and they actually integrate with the researchers and they meet them personally. And so when you meet a person with Fanconi Anemia, and you see the urgency in their eyes of how much help they need, you can say to those researchers 'Stop messing around.' You start, you start working together, because these people need you. And that makes a huge difference when they see 'oh my gosh, the work we're doing is going to directly relate to helping these people' as opposed to 'oh, my protein, and my papers, and my tenure'. So there's a lot of heart in our community. And I think that largely comes from the patients being involved and having touched points for the researchers. So those are all the different areas that we use to kind of galvanize our community. It's not easy, it's not perfect, I spend a lot of time putting out fires, I'm sure there's a lot of back talk, as human beings do. But in the long run it's the only way to move forward on any of these rare diseases. And so we'll just keep doing that until we can't anymore.

Ania K  37:34  
Have you found any difference between working with like big, well known institutions, or like, well known researchers versus like, up and coming researchers, that kind of thing?

Speaker 1  37:45  
Oh, definitely. The old timers are very, 'we don't need to share, we have everything we need.' And then the new the new investigators are very much trying to get into the field and will do anything to get access to the expertise and access to the patients and the tissues and, and everything. So definitely the harder group to work with are the, the older generations, but I think they're even coming around. It's just more of like I said, massaging egos and saying 'yes, yes, you're the best. Yes, yes, we need you.' But if you don't start collaborating, we can't really do anything. And you can't be the only person working on this. Another, I don't know if it's a benefit, but what's different in our field is it for 30 years, everyone was focused on hematologic issues. And so all of our experts are transplant doctors and DNA repair experts. And so now there's a shift to cancer. And so they're not the experts anymore. So they don't know anything about squamous cell carcinoma. And so we're bringing in all these new people. So it's this juxtaposition between the old and the new, but it's the old who are no longer needed for certain things. And so they still want to be part of it. And so they're more collaborative. So it's an interesting landscape, I think, compared to other diseases, maybe where you don't have such a fulcrum of change in terms of what you're looking at for disease.",,"'- Work hard to break down knowledge silos (or avoid their development in the first place).

Speaker 1  48:48  
Oh, yeah. I spent six months trying to get cell lines from Amsterdam, that we didn't end up getting because they have such strict rules about sharing samples that could have genomic studies done on them. Because back in the 80s, they didn't consent their patients who are no, whom are no longer alive, but still, they can't share them. And that's just cell lines. So imagine all the patient data, it's, I know, it's just the data issues. Just it's all if it's for everybody, everybody has this issue. I don't think this is unique to us at all. A lot of organizations I talked to we may have a lot of registries, but in general, I think the data silos is a common problem. And some people are better off than we are.

So one thing we're trying to be cognizant of is, it's great to deal with drug repurposing. But the most important part is how are you actually going to administer it to the population in a meaningful way, where you're gonna get good data with high powered studies, and that's difficult when you don't have so many patients. So as of right now, we're discussing this as if it would come to fruition and the outcomes would be great, but we still are in the phase of: well, should we have one trial? Or should we have a consortium of trials and patients are funneled through the trials based on a genomic analysis or proteomic analysis? And so that's a whole other part of the story that's not necessarily part of this timeline, that we're definitely considering and thinking about because in rare diseases, you don't want to just move forward with one drug, it probably isn't going to be the best interest of the community.

Speaker 1  44:44  
Yeah, it's been great. So we started the registry a couple years ago, I wasn't responsible for it then. And we initially started it out as way too detailed and we don't really have research staff and so it's a patient directed registry. And so we've really scaled it back to be cancer focused and just very basic questions because there are 15 other Fanconi registries worldwide. It's another thing, the patient data is just all over the place, which is another problem. And so we don't really feel as an organization that we need to be responsible for the heavy in depth medical related data. But that should be housed at the NIH, for example, where we have a registry or the Rockefeller University where we have a registry. So what we're working on now is trying to connect all those registries to maybe a global unique identifier or some sort of way to standardize all the data collection. And it's hard because it's another thing as a small organization, should we be the ones doing this or should the academic center be doing this? It's who's pushing all these research initiatives forward, but NORD in on of itself has been great to work with, it's just a slow process, because they're redoing their their platform to incorporate multiple languages. And then it takes them a while to redo data and dictionaries and everything. But everything over the pandemic has just been slowed down. So it's just hard to complain about anything. Everyone's doing the best that they can.

Ania K  46:00  
Yeah, that's really interesting that you have several registries. I don't think I've heard or maybe I haven't been asking that question. I'll make sure to note that. How did those get set up, you know, were you

Speaker 1  46:13  
Well, so when I say registry, it can be either a platform like we have with Nord, or it's a spreadsheet, it's a database spreadsheet that the clinicians have. So this includes international databases, too. So this would be databases in Europe and Brazil, and Mexico. And this is from, because they're 15, you can see the way the world was back then, when they first started collecting all this data, everyone did things on their own. So the Rockefeller University is the International registry, which is the largest one, then the NIH had a long term bone marrow failure study that also has the same participants just a different amount of data. And then each of the major centers, which are at University of Minnesota, Cincinnati, Memorial Sloan Kettering, and Stanford, they collect all their own data on the patients that aren't necessarily synonymous with what's happening at the IFAR registry or at the NIH. And then before I came, our organization wanted to start our own registry, thinking that we could collect additional data. So it just goes on and on. Every group we talked to says, well, we need a registry, because we need to know where our patients are and what's happening, and I don't fault them for that. But then you think, okay, you'll have your 30 patients in your registry, but some of those could also be in this other registry, or you're missing this information that can be useful for your patients. And I think it's just, it's a really hard way to do research on a rare disease, because you're missing the overall big picture, phenotype, genotype all the different connections that one could use from a data analytics perspective. And so it's just where we are. But that would be useful too. It's just hard. You can't make everyone work together, and especially if it's between international borders, and there's language changes, and it's just, it's just difficult.

But it could be the same patients and separate like, 

Speaker 1  48:02  
Yeah, cause some of the international participants are in the NIH registry. They're definitely in the IFAR registry. We have international patients in our registry. And then you talk to the families and they say, 'well there are so many studies, why are we signed up for four studies? And do you know what amount of paperwork that is?' It's, it's just this huge burden for the families, and we're doing all this for them. So you think what are we doing? Or we're just all worried about our own data, and it just doesn't, it's not even helping anyone. So sorry, I just get really frustrated about this, because it's just not helping the communities.

Falconi Anemia.txt,checked,,,"So when our organization was founded in 1989, the way it typically worked was scientists would submit grant proposals to us, we had external reviewers review them, and then an internal committee would review the proposals and then fund them. They did that all the way up until I came, and well, there was one Scientific Director before me, but he wasn't as involved. And then when I took over, one of the ways that I thought that we could be more effective was to make it more organizational directed research. So what happens now is we have different ways people can get funded. One way is they can still submit an investigator-solicited grant or grants. But what happens with those usually now is that they'll go through the external review process and through our committee and then we'll make changes and then we'll say: actually we want you to do aim one but not aim two, we want you to do these drugs, but not these drugs. So we, it's a combination, it's them providing ideas, and then us providing fine tuning, because typically what happens with a lot of research is that they have a lot of great ideas. But that doesn't really translate to helping patients. And so, at the end of the day, you ask, okay, great, that one protein you're studying, that's awesome. But how is that really going to help patients and so we have to really push them to be more translational, because people are dying every day, it's just really, really frustrating. And so you try to make them look at things from a different vantage point. The other way we do research is I actually create programs. So like I mentioned the consortium where I went out to different institutions, and we're funding this to the NIH X, actually, and then seeing what expertise they have and saying, I want you to work on this part of the project, I want you to work on this part of the project, and you're all going to work together, and you're gonna share resources. And so that's the second way that we fund grants, we also do collaborative funding. So we recently collaborated with Stand Up to Cancer to fund a large research team focused on head and neck cancer. So I'd say those are our three main ways of doing it: 1. An investigator solicited directly to us, 2. us reaching out and being FARF-directed projects that we know will directly translate to patient care.

Yeah, and I wouldn't say it's 100% solved the hematologic issue, but at least it's sustaining life. The issues we have with it right now are they have to use either total body radiation or strong chemotherapy to do it. And so you know what that means. We put into a person with DNA repair, all their cells are getting hit, and that's probably why they have a higher risk of cancer. So we have different studies where they're looking at antibody conditioning to clear the bone marrow or gene therapy, for example. So I just want to make sure it's not that it's not an issue anymore. It's just they're living longer and so there's this other shoe has dropped this just been really, really hard to contend with.

",,Issue: Rare diseases have compounding problems
Falconi Anemia.txt,checked,,,"So after 30 years of research that FARF (Fanconi Anemia Research Fund) has contributed to we were able to increase the likelihood of survival from transplants, just changing different protocols and changing the different conditioning agents that are used. So it moved from a childhood disease to an adult disease. And so what's happening now, though, that's the problem is all the patients are getting cancer and they have an astronomically high risk of getting head and neck cancer. So they have 700 fold increased risk compared to general population and you know, general cancer, 1000s fold increased risk. Breast cancer, medulloblastoma, liver cancer, esophageal cancer, you name it, they would probably get it eventually if they live long enough. So the issue with these patients though, is because their disorder's a DNA repair issue, they cannot be treated safely with most chemotherapy, DNA intercalating agents, for example, or radiation therapy, you can try but then the issue is that the rest of their cells would be adversely affected by it as well. So we're extremely interested in drug repurposing, because if there is a safer, gentler therapy that could target their tumor specifically without harming the rest of their bodies, we would want to know about that. And so if there are different options, for example, Metformin is another drug that we've been studying for the hematologic issues, but that could maybe offer some cancer prevention issues. I didn't mention that in the survey because it's not really something that at the time, we'd actually found anything that would be useful for in terms of cancer. So it's not really drug repurposing in that sense. So when we first started reaching out to our scientific community and looking for different research projects, we wanted to do drug identification studies. So we had researchers in Spain, do some screening on 3800 compounds, I think is what it was, using cell lines and PDX models, and they came out with EGFR targeting molecules that would be the most efficacious in the cell lines and the PDX models. And also, they found that in the bone marrow failure models that we use to determine whether or not the drugs are toxic for FA patients, they weren't toxic. So really, ideally, that's a long story for you. But really, the the leveraging points for drug repurposing are cancer, sensitive population, and no treatments.

Speaker 1  42:32  
I wish before I hadn't gotten here that, well, we didn't really know cancer is going to be big issue, but that the patients could have been galvanized in a better way so that there was a better systematic approach for funneling them through a system. So you could have all their data in one place, all their tumor samples, like excised, and a central IRB, just a better system. For those initial studies that one would need to develop resources, because that's where we've been stuck is just the, the necessary elements that one would need to actually do drug repurposing studies really and do artificial intelligence, acquisition of data or analysis of data, I mean, so it's, it's really that resource building of research tools. And then the patients being part of that that line of work, because right now, the patients are just seen everywhere. And I feel like it's this mad dash to save them. So we have this virtual tumor board. And we'll get a column with 'so and so has metastasized head and neck cancer, and we're just going to try PDL1 and then see what happens.' And then we never hear from them again. And then it happens to someone else and other they're going to try radiation, but then the patient dies, and we never hear from them. So everything is just, it's like putting out fires. And so I think if we hit early on, develop the better approach to a registry and patient involvement, patient advocacy, but those are things I'm sure everyone is grappling with. I just wish that we had better infrastructure for that we're getting there, it's getting better. And I think that'll really launch us into the realm where we need to be. But it's just hard also with data protection and HIPAA violation and all these things. And then mental health issues. It's another thing with this patient population that I think really will adversely affect our ability to help them because they just won't want to be part of research studies, because they're so afraid to go get biopsies and find out that they have cancer, so just resources to help the actual patients understand the importance of research and helping them and also patients of the future.

If you really want to move the research forward fast, you need a lot of money. And so our model is unique, and that all the families who are affected by this fundraise for us, we don't do our own fundraising, per se.

And so they're doing all this fundraising. So it's just wonderful for them to be able to contribute. But also, I think, a big burden.

Ania K  52:13

Yeah, so typically in the past, our grants have tapped out at $250,000. Although more recently, we've given out a million dollars, for example, the NIH for their study. So in some respects, it's not enough, but we've got a pretty good track record in terms of PIs going out and getting federal funding following grants from us, it's just hard to get federal funding for rare disease. But I think Fanconi Anemia, may get more traction in the general research space, though, because five of the genes are breast cancer susceptibility genes. And so I always try to say if you can cure cancer in these patients, you can cure in anybody, because the drugs that you'd have to figure out to use in a Fanconi patient will be way less toxic, so it's efficacious. And then you could save people with breast cancer across the gamut. So these genes are actually really important in a lot of cancer pathways. They are cancer.

If it works, and it's out there. You know, let's do it. Let's get it approved for those indications so that it will be approved for insurance long term.

So I'm not certain we're going to repeat that study or not, or just do a human study, study with that drug. But as I segue, you know, there's three drugs that you may have heard me refer to the cocktail. And it's actually the Sirolimus, the Tacrolimus, and the IV prednisone, IV Methylprednisone, when administered together, seem to have great synergy. And there is scientific rationale for that, that Prednisone is, is neuroprotective, and I think that it, it helps the blood brain barrier heal it so that the drugs can get through more efficiently. The Tacrolimus and Sirolimus because those two drugs are both kn - known to induce autophagy, which is an ultimate clearance mechanism to get junk out of the cell. So I just refer to that repurposing as the cocktail. And, yeah, the jury's out. It could be just adding the Tacrolimus and the Sirolimus orally is all you need. But maybe we do need the methylprednisone, but I actually have a geneticist at Columbia queued up, I believe she's gonna give Hannah this cocktail. She actually asked me to write the protocol. So I have a noon call today with a transplant immunologist at the NIH that kind of helped us design, that cocktail. And the original purpose for that cocktail was immunomodulation for the gene therapy, the AAV9 GAN gene, gene therapy, that viral mediated gene transfer, because we had to make certain that patients that endogenously didn't make the protein because of, you know, the harsh mutation that they had on each copy of their gene. We had to make certain the immune system didn't see the protein as foreign, and launch, you know, like a cytokine storm and basically kill every cell expressing what's supposed to be the therapeutic transgene. So, miraculously, immediately following that cocktail before the AAV viral vector machinery could have a chance to really even start making the protein. You know, an axonal transport is one millimeter a day, it takes a couple years to know if those gene therapies are successful. So way too soon for the gene therapy to be having any impact.

You know, it's, it's, I can't even get my blood pressure up about it. It's unreal since 2000—May of 2015. They've injected 15 patients for the gene therapy clinical trial. 15. Since May, you know, you know, without being accountable to shareholders, there's no urgency and the NIH is so big, and these MDs, who's going to tell them what to do. Francis Collins certainly isn't. He's the director of the NIH, you know, it's, there's no accountability, there's no accountability to a timeline, nothing.

Hannah's Hope Fund.txt,,,,"The natural history study, we started, but it transitioned to the NIH when they agreed to take the gene therapy clinical study. So I think there's only six patients on the Sirolimus. Five of them needed it because of their mutation definition for the gene therapy. They were predicted to be null for the protein. The other one is the one in Canada, where her neurologists based on her, you know, grim MRI findings declines, decided to do it. So right now it, with her, it's, you know, I don't know, when the doctor plans do a follow up MRI. But if it shows some stability, then we can really put it toward the Sirolimus. And then, you know, I'm kind of waiting to see this cocktail with Hannah. If it's really good, we'll, we'll fund a study with that. And they may only need the cocktail, like the IV Prednisone, like twice a year. And they may like prophylactically, just stay on both the Tacrolimus and the Sirolimus.

We don't need to deviate from it, you know, maybe the next interval, we wouldn't do the IV prednisone and just do the Tacrolimus and Sirolimus. But I'm really convinced that this cocktail really clears out a lot of the garbage and kind of resets the axons back down to zero, you know, and then over time, the, the intermediate filaments start accumulating again, but I think it's really cleaning a lot of them, the junk out of the cells.",,,,,"Step: Clinical Trial,Org Support: developing/supporting natural history study and/or registry"

And typically, by the time they start to show the symptoms, they're already well over a year old. And then by the time they get a diagnosis, they're almost two years old. And by then they're already symptomatic. And so it's almost considered - gene therapy is almost considered too late for symptomatic children. That's what they say.

Can we safely deliver a gene therapy and maybe a cocktail of drugs that again, are safe? For us, it's safety, right? Most important for anybody, safety is most important.

Yeah, we weren't actually involved.

Speaker 1  39:49  
What's the secret. Yeah, like, interestingly, though, like the literature says that the incidence of bullous pemphigoid is, is greater than pemphigus vulgaris. So, you know, the literatures would show that there's more need for bullous pemphigoid. And there's more opportunity for the drug company to make money off bullous pemphigoid then there would be off PV, but PV, PV approval came first. So, so, you know, I think there's a couple reasons, and I think BP or bullous pemphigoid is really attractive right now. And I think I mentioned there's a bunch of drugs in development now for the disease, but one is, and for both diseases, our diseases, generally, the demographic is like 50 or older. And then with bullou pemphigoid, it's even higher. So it's like 65 or older. So I think inherently as our popu— as the general population ages, there's going to be more people that get this disease. So, so it's kind of like a foresight to say, okay, more people are gonna get this disease as they get older. So the pop—, so there'll be more incidents, and, you know, greater opportunity as the population gets older. But it also means that there's, there's also, there's also like, there's more of an unmet need, because I don't want to say ageism, but I mean, that's, that's kind of true, right. I mean, like, you know, the access, you know, access for, access to health care gets more difficult the older you get, particularly with, particularly in the United States, our health system's not that great. So, I mean, the older you get, the harder it is to get the treatments that you need. So. So and, you know, again, I think our disease, you know, because our disease is pretty well characterized, you know, it's easy to, it's easy to study. So I mean, I think there were just, there were some things that they said, Okay, you know, there's, you know, things about like, equity and inclusion and diversity and things like that, like, all of those things started to develop, you know, people are like, oh, you know, older people don't have access to these things, and we want to be inclusive and things like that.

There were no like, clinical trials or anything that had been done, but there was like, a lot of literature and a lot of small studies that had been done about the use of the drug.

Speaker 1  1:36  
Well. Well, I mean, obviously, being a patient with a rare skin disease, I mean, that, you know, that's kind of where I started. But I also wanted to learn as much as I could about the disease, and, you know, not only about, you know, how to, to manage the disease on a personal level, but also more about the, about the science of the disease. So, you know, as I started to become more educated and learn more about the disease, I learned about, you know, those specific, the mechanisms of the disease or the targets of the disease, how to inhibit those targets.

So some insurance companies will approve it, some won't. Right. And then you have patients that are saying, Well, is it really the same? Or is it similar? Right. Is the biosimilar the equivalent or is it similar? So it depends on who you ask, right. I mean, it's supposed to be, I don't know if the FDA says it's supposed to be equivalent, or if it's supposed to be similar. I don't, I don't know. But, but potentially, it's also more cost effective for patients. Right. So if it's a generic, it's less expensive for patients, so. So if there's a patient that wants to get the biosimilar, because it's more cost effective, maybe they can't get it, and they end up having to pay them more money for the expensive drug.

And the next step actually happened and as the slide shows, in the fruit fly experiment, where it was discovered that these mutations in the TSC gene, regulate the central mTOR pathway that leads to abnormal growth and proliferation of cells. And once the central discovery of mTOR pathway was discovered, it was relatively easy to make the connection that there is a pre existing drug called Sirolimus that is a targeted inhibitor of the mTOR pathway. So this was very rapidly tested in a preclinical model, which showed the desired, expected results. And it was then taken to single center phase two trials, one in Cincinnati, one almost similar timeframe in the UK. And they both showed very good results, and which subsequently led to the design and conduct of the pivotal phase three trial, which showed the efficacy that led to the FDA and regulatory approval of Sirolimus within U.S., and now in EU and many other countries in the world. There are multiple aspects of, you know, the, these progressions along the trials, and perhaps some lessons learned along them that, that I think are important for us to walk through.

No, no. It's the, I think I've already said this, it's just appreciating sort of the softer side of relationship building.

Ania K  32:22  
Yeah, so tell me more about that. Because I think pharmaceutical company relations is one of the bigger roadblocks that organizations have been, have been mentioning that either, you know, it's adversarial or kind of confusing. They're like withholding data, and nobody knows what's going on. So how was the relationship with Pfizer? Like any, any tips on like, how to keep them interested and involved, or any, and I don't - learnings you can pass on to other organizations?

Speaker 2  32:48  
I don't know that I can knowledgeably comment on that. And it is, you know, now, what, 15 years later, and I think the world has changed. Nishant I don't know if you've ever, you were talking with Frank about this. But my, my sense has always been that in those days, hate to say that, there was a collegiality and an interest, and interest and good relationships. But that, I guess it's, I wasn't there. I mean, I think it was just really persistence.

Speaker 3  33:27  
Ania, could I ask you to please repeat the question for me when?

Ania K  33:31  
Sure. I was asking about kind of the relationship with, with Pfizer with like the pharmaceutical company, as you were, like I guess maybe specifically in those four years where you had data, and they were kind of not interested, it was going off patent. So like, how did you, like, if you, again, if you know, if you don't know, that's, that's totally fine. But one of the big roadblocks that other organizations have mentioned, like how do we talk to pharmaceutical companies? How do we get them interested in supporting, you know, the clinical trial or FDA approval? Like how do we kind of build that relationship and make sure that they're interested in kind of answering our emails, like if you have any thoughts about kind of relationship with pharma, pharmaceutical companies in general?

Speaker 3  34:13  
Yeah, good question. I think Sue has mentioned, one of the keywords there being persistence. And, you know, Pfizer, we've always had a good relationship with Pfizer when it comes to Sirolimus and LAM and I think that stemmed from the fact that they were also able to see just such a close connection between the pathway and the likelihood of success. And that is always, you know, we, our main points of contact with Pfizer were always the people on the scientific side at the organization. And we trusted that any sort of petitioning on our behalf will sort of happen from the science side and hopefully it makes enough of an argument to the, on the business side of pharma company. And when we have engaged with other pharmaceutical companies, it's at least my modus operandi has been similar in that we keep the engagement on the scientific side and let that sort of go through. The other thing is that a lot of pharmaceutical companies do have their own proposals which they invite investigators to submit grants. And if, and if they rise to the top similar to any other grant application that they would support. And we have also successfully leveraged the Pfizer investigator initiated grant program to get some support for other trials. Before Sirolimus use.

Ania K  35:47  
Okay, so you're really engaging with kind of their science side rather than just their communications or HR department of just messaging anybody random. Are you also inviting them to your conferences? Like there, is there kind of a specific person that you're really like, quote on quote, friends with that you're always like, emailing. So it's kind of like a champion on the inside? Is that kind of the relationship?

Speaker 2  36:12  
Now or then?

Ania K  36:14  
I guess, either, or both.

Speaker 2  36:19  
Yeah, well, just stepping back to complete the thought on the relationship with Pfizer. Pfizer did pretty much say no, and it wasn't until the citizens petition threat through the FDA, turned into a phone call with our scientists and the FDA and Pfizer that they were convinced. And I think that gets back to that persistence element. You know, we, we still have a good relationship with the Pfizer team. Mostly, we're interacting with them to get global approval of Sirolimus in other countries. And that's remarkably, even though it's off patent, Pfizer has continued to be a leader and Nishant, you can talk to the additional work in the European Union with, with Sirolimus. And we do invite them and we try to keep them engaged. It's, you know, given where the drug is in their, their universe, there's a lot less interest unless we're expanding globally.

Ania K  37:26  
That's 

Speaker 3  37:27  
And the short answer on your question is yes, we, we do at least a couple of people who have helped us over the years, we try to keep them informed and stay engaged. They have also, in turn being helpful because, you know, often we run into issues with an international patient and some country not being able to access the drug. And we often reach out to our Pfizer contacts to see if they can help in any way. And the European story that Sue mentioned, so after FDA approval, Pfizer applied for approval through the EMA. And EMA, uh,  granted them conditional approval, with the specification that the long term safety and efficacy of this drug needs to be studied in a prospective manner. And that's where we, our, as it so happened around the same time, we already had an existing prospective longitudinal Natural History registry for lab. And we were able to collaborate with Pfizer and tell EMA that we will use the data from this registry and give it to Pfizer and use that data to help with the EMA approval or the full EMA approval. And after four years of longitudinal data collection, we were actually able to obtain full EMA approval in just a few months ago. And so that was another example of a collaboration between academia, our foundation funded project and you know, something now provides access to Sirolimus to 28 countries now.",,"'- the drug is going off patent and the pharmaceutical company submits it for an orphan disease, they get an extension as an orphan drug designation; so it's beneficial for them to get it in right before it goes off patent

LAM Foundation.txt,checked,,,"Are you, are you also focusing on novel, novel drug development, or gene therapy at the same time as a drug repurposing efforts? Or no?

Speaker 3  2:41  
We are and, you know, by we, I mean, the collective we of the scientific community, you know, from a foundation standpoint, there are, there is really not a whole lot of internal research that happens at the foundation, one of the biggest ways the foundation facilitates research is by giving out grants to other investigators. And, and right from the get go, there has been, once we understood the pathway, and there has been a deep interest in identifying other complementary ways of targeting the pathway. And some of those end up in identifying targets that have more drugs to be repurposed. And some of those end up in identifying new potential pathways. And so the short answer to your question is both.

Speaker 2  3:33  
And I would add from a patient advocacy perspective, I think the nugget here is from day one, the focus of the mission was always research first. You know, I think that it's, there is this genuine tension and pull about how best to invest funds that are raised, is it in, is it in clinical support? Is it in patient support? And while we do some of that, the absolute priority has always been building a scientific network, doing, having the grant program, investing in pilot or small grants that then can be leveraged with good data into larger grants from the NIH or the DOD. And so that would be the takeaway is building that network of research scientists who are interested in this disease so you can start to find those targets.

Ania K  4:25  
Gotcha. And between the, the different focuses, how are you, like, are you putting most of your efforts into drug repurposing? And then the others are kind of like, you seed fund and they're more long term projects, or how are you kind of balancing the different approaches? Because, I imagine it's pretty expensive to try to like fund novel drug development, drug repurposing, and gene therapy all at once. So how are you kind of balancing all those?

Speaker 3  4:52  
Yeah, I mean, gene therapy really is, is in very much in its infancy and - and most likely a mesenchymal tumor like LAM will not be the first target for gene therapy, it will likely be epithelial diseases like cystic fibrosis, etc, before it happens. So we haven't really spent very much or hardly any money when it comes to, you know, spending, allocating resources to gene therapy. With regards to the other aspect as to which way we target our funding allocations that's primarily driven by the same process as any other federal grant process that we solicit applications, and based on their scientific merit by an independent peer review, the applications that rise to the top get funding. So over the years, this has sort of just naturally balanced itself out towards repurposing versus new drugs, depending upon the merit of the proposal and the likelihood that this proposal will go to the clinic and have potential patient benefit. From a foundation standpoint, that is the metric by which every proposal really gets judged as what is the potential for downstream clinical benefit.

Ania K  6:11  
Right, so would you add anything to add?

Speaker 2  6:14  
No, I mean, it really is. Hearing it in this context, it's, it's staying true to what worked in the beginning.

No, I thought this is better suited for you. But I think this was always my recollection is that thism that they were interested, but that ultimately, the off pattern thing that Sue said, basically led to the somewhat of a decrease interest from them until the citizens petition thing came in and then, and then FDA I think had a conversation with them, too.

Speaker 2  28:34  
Right. Yeah. So the, in 11, when the the initial results were published, there was an initial decision by Pfizer not to pursue FDA approval. So then, the foundation considered the citizens petition, which was the alternate route through the FDA. And then the FDA contacted Pfizer. And as Nishant just said, there were conversations there. And that that was going to be the most efficient path was for Pfizer to submit. So then the MILES team, the data center, and Pfizer worked for, this is, this is from my notes on a presentation. Worked for two years and submitted a 2562 page clinical study report that was required for the filing. So they had to go, well, what what was the nature of that Nishant? They had to go back through and re, reassess all the data because it was investigator load.

Um, again, I wasn't there. My understanding is that it was an alternative route through the FDA where patients slash citizens are able to petition the government to request it to take certain actions. So that, so this particular petition, petition was to change the product label for Sirolimus. In the absence, so I'm looking at my notes, it, even in the absence of an application from the manufacturer, ultimately, the negotiation was that that was one route. But it wasn't the preferred route that we really needed Pfizer to push this through, which is what ultimately happened.

Speaker 3  1:03  
Yeah. So on the upside of the search for a drug was, you know, didn't start with the intent that it has to be a repurposed drug, the search for a drug or the search for a treatment started in the context of LAM has to, as with any other disease, perhaps, hey, let's understand the molecular pathogenesis. And based on that, we can see which targets seem right. And, as it so transpired, that when the discovery of the genetic mutation and the main pathway that, that mutation was targeting, there was a ready made drug that already existed. So the, so the repurposing happened, because that's where the science led us to being the most likely target for success.

Definitely. And I guess I have to, like mentioned that you're part of our bigger Sirolimus family of our, like, there's so many organizations that are doing Sirolimus, we're, you know, we're kind of relatives in that our organizations are all focusing on, um, then there's so many and I actually wanted, maybe before we jump into the, the timeline, do you have any thoughts about, I guess, two questions, of maybe why, why, in your perspective, so many organizations are focusing on Sirolimus? And then separately, if you feel like, is there enough kind of collaboration among these different diseases and organizations? Or is there any value in coming together, like everybody that is focusing on repurposing Sirolimus, or more like data sharing, or some more collaboration? I guess, those two questions, either of you have any thoughts?

Speaker 3  16:41  
Yeah, so just in terms of, just short answers, would be why Sirolimus is such a popular drug, I think that primarily stems from the fact that the, the pathway targets the mTOR pathway, it is such a central pathway in terms of the cell metabolism. You know, it's one of the major gates that senses your energy and nutrition, and then switches on, in an on and off fashion to tell your cells and your body, whether they should be, you know, growing, or they should be staying quiet in a survival mode. And that's just to the very basic function that is driven by this pathway. And so it's not a surprise that as you go through multiple disorders, they, a lot of them funnel through mTOR, which makes targeting this pathway, and as such, using Sirolimus as a attractive pathway for multiple diseases. In fact, we have, ourselves tried to study this drug in more than one diseases over the past few years. The second aspect, I think, is very important, and I think that it can be improved. We often see or hear about this pathway being targeted by other diseases. Sometimes we have conversations around that aspect. Sometimes we don't. And a lot of times people are sort of working in their silos. I think if there was a way to connect multiple rare disease organizations who are working on this pathway together, I think that will be mutually beneficial for us and for them. You know, we may just by virtue of being limited to the lung field know of, hey, what are the pulmonary conditions or what other conditions and related pathway are being used, but we are obviously not aware of everything, and I suspect the same holds true for others. So if there is a way to bring this community together with an interest on the pathway, I think that would be helpful.

Ania K  18:44  
Yeah, well, at least we have the organizations that are in our database we know of a list are doing Sirolimus so we can definitely. And there's like a fine line between like how much information we can share of like, who's studying which drug, as organizations are more open to sharing that information than others. But since Sirolimus is off patent, I think a Sirolimus Club is a little bit more open to maybe sharing that information. But it just seems to come up so much that I feel like there needs to be, like we need a whole Sirolimus conference just to just to cover Sirolimus, or like every time somebody reaches out to Pfizer, I feel like maybe like a group email rather than like poking them all individually. I think they might appreciate that as well. Okay, so basically, with this timeline, I pre populated your survey responses. And since it's been, I mean, I think you guys took the survey in October, some things might have changed. We've also found that some things are sometimes inaccurate. So if anything looks amiss, feel free to let me know and I can definitely update the data. But basically this is how we've been approaching this, this idea of aggregating all of these stories is to try to map them on a timeline. So how did this project specifically, you know happen, was there some sort of specific prep stage for this project, like did you develop really sources or staff or funding specifically for this drug repurposing project. How did the drug identification happen? Like, was it like as preclinical researcher, looking at similar diseases, some people use machine learning or high throughput drug screening. Was there other pre, preclinical work that happened, obviously, some sort of clinical trial period, and then an outcome, whether it's FDA approval or on the alternative outcome. So based on that timeline, and the pre populated answers, we can kind of go through and I'll try to fill in some of the details as we talk. But also don't worry about, since we're recording, we have a transcript, don't worry about like all of the details being captured perfectly. So I guess, let me I don't, I guess since I don't know when this, exactly this process started. Were you involved? Were you there at like when it was first identified as promising?

LAM Foundation.txt,checked,,,"Maybe I can take a stab at it. So, you know, things I would like to tell, which wasn't a roadblock for us. But I think things I would like to tell others about that. Some of the key lessons were that the more organized the patient community is from the get go, the easier it is to find patients for trials. And, and one of the ways to do that is to, obviously find patients to come together but also to distribute expertise in other centers. That is not inherently the first instinct that comes to mind. A lot of times people, our centers want to hold expertise. And the more you can distribute expertise, the better it is when it comes to pivotal trials, because you're going to need collaborators across multiple institutions to do this. So these, none of these were necessarily roadblocks for us because that was something that was previously well thought of by Sue and Frank, but I think these are important lessons nevertheless. Something which was a roadblock, which is something to, to mention and some, is that clinical trials are hard, clinical trials are messy. Finding patients with a rare disease for a trial is infinitely more difficult than what you might envision. And getting funding and getting the logistics and regulatory aspects aligned, especially if you're going internationally makes it just orders of magnitude harder. So I think that, that aspect needs to be very carefully thought about in terms of the timing, the resources, the funding, and what regulatory aspects need to be considered, you know, even within, within LAM, with all the organization, etc, that we talked about. And the target that just was, we knew this was going to hit. The MILES trial, we talked about 89, the trial was actually sub powered with a sample size of 120. So, so at the end, we actually were massively under what was the power of the trial. And even within that, it took a final push with an amended protocol to include patients in the last few months in a bit of a crazy race to the finish.

And as all the other patients and MEPAN doesn't seem to be a life-shortening disease, although there's probably some, you know, comorbidities and things involved, but we have patients in their 40s and 50s. So that was the other reason to try to find a small molecule is that, you know, at least get something that can help address the, you know, patient's symptoms, and then, you know, then you can still have these other things going on, like an AAV therapy, or an ASO or something that might be more curative, you know, further on down the road.

So I mean, that was like first thing in our roadmap, again, just to generate the data because there was - there really is no data or very little data about the disease itself from other than that - the one paper that was done in 2016 that first brought that - the MEPAN syndrome to, to the literature. Prior to 2016 it was unknown. And so it was identified in this paper and that was really the only thing that existed. You know, that was patient specific.

No, we were fortunate to have a partner partner with an academic institution and Perlara on a sort of a pilot project. And so much of the foundational work in the prep was already done using an existing paper where they looked at MECR. So MECR, the gene that's involved they, they looked at MECR mutations in a paper. And, and basically, the team at UCSF just sort of used that model, and that data from that paper to sort of build the yeast models just re- you know, duplicate what was done in that paper.

You know, and there's, there's all different kinds, there's all different libraries, but you know, most of them are 1500, 2000 compounds, you know, when you're talking about FDA approved drugs. And so, you know, that was, that was a pretty good. starting place, and the choice was, I mean, the, the idea was, is, you know, again, with the idea of speed is speed is of the essence and efficiencies. You want FDA approved compounds, because you don't have to do tox, you don't have to do any of the other stuff that you might have to do with a novel compound. You know, even if it's only been tried in adults, at least you've got some solid basis that, you know, it's not going to kill anyone, or you're going to know what the side effects are going to be. And so it's much easier to get that that treatment to clinic. So that was that was the idea of that, behind that.

Ania K  11:30  
And then tell me a little bit more about like, how they - 'cause there's different ways to do drug repurposing. So not everybody does high throughput drug screens. So do you know of why they chose to go in that direction? Especially with such a broad - like, there's, you said, 1500 compounds? So it's quite a big 

Speaker 1  11:33  
Actually, 2500.

Ania K  11:45  
2500. Right. So do you do know of some of the like the decisions of why they chose to go with that library, or with that many compounds, rather than some other options? Were you involved in that decision making?

Speaker 1  12:00  
So when you say other options, what do you mean?

Ania K  12:04  
Well, some, some are more targeted. So there's smaller screen. Some people don't even do screening - like they do, they go to preclinical research, you know, and identify something that's maybe in the literature or that makes sense based on the disease understanding, and then pursue the drug repurposing that way, so that [overlapping]

Speaker 1  12:23  
Because because it's unbiased, you're not starting out with any preconceived biases, you're go - you know, just using straight and you're just generating data. So because I think, at least from my perspective, and I think Ethan would agree to some degree, some- like, there's preconceived notions about what drugs will work or not work. I mean, if you think about another neurodegenerative condition, Alzheimer's disease, where it's all about TAU, and beta-amyloid tangles, and, you know, that's, we need to get something that's addressing that. They've been trying that for 20 years, and they still haven't figured it out. That probably means that you're - they're, they're - you're doing - you're looking at the wrong - in the wrong area. And so I think it's really important to approach something in an unbiased fashion. So go with, you know - cast the widest net, and then narrow it down. And I think to to, to, like, for example, to do a smaller library that, you know, only drugs that are CNS penetrant, you know, is misguided, and, you know, you're just missing - and it also depends on the condition. Our condition is a, it's a mitochondrial disease. It's a nuclear gene, but it has, you know, causes mitochondrial defects. But it's also - the pathway that's involved is highly conserved. And it's a - it's got - it's, you know, it has to do with metabolism. And I think it's really important, again, to cast that wide net, because there are no treatments for mitochondrial diseases. So that's another consideration as well. No currently approved treatments. And because it's sort of a metabolic condition, I mean, there's - I believe that you know, there's probably some diabetes drug or some drug that's that's already out there that could have an impact.",,"'- When doing drug screen, wanted to use FDA-approved library
- An advantage of DR is that it can allow you to skip certain steps of the drug approval process that novel drugs are required to go through, such as tox studies (easier to move trials forward if you already have information on s/e, safety profile, etc)
- Org might decide to start with a large group of compounds (rather than a smaller group) because it is a more ""unbiased"" approach - your research isn't being shaped by preconceived assumptions/notions of which drugs will/won't work. You can always narrow things down after casting a wide net. 
- Decision re: which drug compounds / how many to test can also be guided by RD characteristics.

You don't want to do that, you know, but at the same time, I'm like, Okay, we have like, five grants that researchers applied for, for NIH funding. How in the world, do we kick start that and get them to apply for more? So that's part of one of our deals is do we - do we do smaller grants or catalyst grants? We've never done that.

Okay,

So it was, you know, we did things like -- to tell you the truth, I think, if I remember right, we got the drug - or one of our researchers got the drug donated on a compassionate whatever. Apparently, he told me the story not that long ago. So it's a little more fresh in my mind. But he said, typically Big Pharma, who owns these kind of drugs, their answer is no, you know, it's just their standard answer is no, but he just happened to be on a bus with somebody from Pfizer, in Serbia, I mean, it was like a really weird thing. And he told him, they got to chatting, they will go into some weird, obscure conference over there in that part of the world. And yeah, just crazy. And maybe it was Croatia, it was either. Anyway, it was one of those two countries. But anyway, they got to talking about it. And that person talked to him and said, you know, that's unacceptable to not get that, that's a drop in the bucket. And then that person went back and got in the approval. So talk about roadblocks, you know, but from what I understand is, you know, maybe the drug companies don't want to be dealing with these experimental things. Maybe there's, you know, problems, you know, or liabilities. I don't know, I I'm guessing, I have no idea. But apparently, their standard is no, so that could potentially be one. But needless to say, we got that. But, you know, PC project, we did things like, you know, we had to fly the patients out, you know, put them up in a hotel, that kind of stuff. Because when you're that rare, you can't just say, Oh, we're doing like, I'm in Salt Lake City. We can't just do Salt Lake City patients, because, well, there's a whole whopping two of us, you know, so that's one of the challenges of, you know, doing a clinical trial with a rare disease. You know, you're scattered everywhere. So yeah, we were big funders in all of that. So.

Ania K  31:48  
So Pfizer, donated, I guess, the the oral drug, and then somebody else turned it into a topical or they had a topical?

Speaker 1  31:54  
No, I think they they I think the oral, I think, oh gosh, I hope I don't get this wrong. Don't quote me. Darn, it's being recorded.

Pachyonychia Congenita Project.txt,,,,"And you are - so you are hoping for FDA approval to kind of solve some of those access issues? Because I mean, yeah, because off -- Sirolimus is available off label. So some organizations that are pursuing repurposing, like there's not -- looking at the benefit, to cost ratio of having to go through all the clinical trials and the regulatory roadblocks. While that -- even you can just get it off label, like it tends to skew towards like, okay, it's okay, if we don't get an FDA approved, like, because it's available to the population already. But for the - for this case, because you need the topical, it's not available off label, so that kind of skews it back back towards approval, it seems like. 

Speaker 1  38:51  
Yeah, and so that helps me a little bit. So it, you know, just the oral is available off label. So if your doctor went and prescribed it for you, you can get insurance to pay for it, no matter what your disease is?

Ania K  39:03  
So the insurance is still an issue. It depends - it really depends on on the disease. I mean, it's approved for, you know, for renal transplant rejection and LAM, whatever LAM stands for, like, it's the LAM Foundation, but I forget what the disease is called. So it's approved for things in the US so you can get it off label, but there's been, you know, different different insurance companies will cover it for different things. So it is a - it is still an issue. But if you, you know, submit the documents for why you need to get it approved by the insurance, like, they are - they're able to get through those. It's not easy, but it is it is possible. If if FDA approval, you know, is not kind of in the cards, then then some organizations are going into that path.

And then they did research on mini pigs or mini, yeah, mini pigs, and found out that the drug was staying in the system, like 51 days or something like that.

Makes sense. And the phase three is still ongoing?

Speaker 1  34:49  
Yes, we're almost through with enrollment.

And in fact, if, you know, if you want to know my big complaints, you know, I just go, ah, I guess - I get that they have to have enough data, sound data, but boy, when you're a rare disease, and they're expecting you to pull up, you know, even for phase three, we've screened literally 257 patients. That is like a miracle in our, in our book, you know, to be able to have that many patients, you know, with this very rare disease, who are willing to at least raise their hand. And of course, there's, you know, all the screening that happens, you know, there's always a screen fail rate for anything from -- I'm just trying to think -- they smoke marijuana to being pregnant. I mean, there's just all kinds of possible reasons to get, you know, screened out. So that's, that's a weird disease challenge that, you know, it's so hard because especially with something like a topical Rapamycin, Sirolimus, the the side effects are just nothing, you know, I mean, the the tox studies have come back shining. Nobody's reported any bad results, and it's just like, dang, why can't they just pass that thing?

And this, I think this is a really important, you know, point in repurposing for ALS or other neuro indications that, you know, we've talked about ad nauseam with Dave before but when you're talking about a brain disease, most drugs are designed to not cross the blood brain barrier because you don't want things to get into the brain if they don't need to, you know, you want to protect that, that CNS space.

And in a lot of cases, these sorts of co-administrations caused really terrible side effects. So we found, for example, that we could get a different chemotherapeutic agent into the brain. And it actually seems sort of neuro protective, but the side effects, like animals were dying from the side effects of the actual drug administration. So this was really a turning point for us actually, where we realized that drug repurposing efforts for ALS and other neuro indications would really have to focus on compounds that we know can get into the brain or on building delivery systems that would allow us to repurpose drugs and get them into the brain. And those sort of became our twin focuses moving forward, you know, how do we get things into the brain? Or can we just design better drugs that get into the brain on their own. And, you know, I, this sort of goes without saying, but this was a big disappointment, because it sort of cut off this, you know, fast track idea that we had, where we would be able to take an FDA approved drug and just give it to somebody, you know, with ALS and see if it was hopefully beneficial.

In the process that our research partners at Columbia use, these motor neurons are subjected to ALS, like stressors, and then you screen for potential drugs that could rescue the stressors and protect motor neurons.

Oh, yeah, I mean, I think it actually came out of a range of screens. So one of the main priorities Project ALS has been around for 25 years at this point. And one of the main priorities really, from the beginning, was building more predictive drug screening models for ALS. So ALS is of course, a brain disease, it impacts brain cells called motor neurons. And one of the main challenges in trying to identify or develop drugs is that you can't, you don't have direct access to the cells that are impacted, right. So you can take a biopsy of someone's spinal cord and see what's going on in their motor neurons. And this was a major hurdle to drug discovery and drug development and really understanding the disease at a basic level. So from the beginning, Project ALS has been sort of a champion for stem cell models of ALS, you know, and over time has worked to improve those to the point where, you know, we were behind the first patient derived stem cell models of ALS. So, you know, in a process, you can take a skin punch from somebody who has ALS, sort of reverse time on them to make them stem cell likes induced pluripotent stem cells, it was a breakthrough from Shinya Yamanaka that won the Nobel Prize in 2006. And then make these stem cell-like cells that carry the DNA of somebody with ALS into motor neurons that you can then study in the lab. So it's not exactly the same as taking the motor neuron from the spinal cord, but it's a good stand in to actually study the human disease. And once we figured out how to do this, and you know, I'm really skipping a lot. And it's not a perfect model by any means. But what it did enable was sort of, you know, large scale drugs screens to try to see what rescues a motor neuron with ALS in a laboratory setting. And that was, you know, with our partners at Columbia, and Harvard, and other institutions, like 10 or so years ago, we just started screening 1000s of compounds of you know, some of them were drugs, it was just, you know, big compound libraries that you could buy. And that included tool compounds, things that had never been developed, supplements, things that were FDA approved. And we realized through that drug screen that there were drugs, you know, FDA approved drugs, drugs that were in development for other indications, and as I said, supplements that seemed to be somewhat effective in rescuing motor neurons in a dish in the lab.

Each of these screens and the studies has helped us to understand, you know, the exact pathways that each of these drugs is targeting, it's really helped our understanding of like how to potentially optimize a novel therapy and what you would want to look for and not look for.

So, around the time that this sort of popped in our, our assay, there was a group at I think it was at Georgetown, it was at Georgetown, that found that Bosutinib and another similar drug, were protective in Parkinson's disease. So, you know, interestingly, you know, ALS, obviously, is, is a rare neuro, neuro, neurological disease, but it's closely related to very non rare diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. And so another major through line in our, in our research or another, you know, sort of recurring theme is that it, even though these diseases manifests very differently, a lot of the internal pathways like the basics so that proteins like misfold, there's a, something that goes wrong, it causes proteins in neurons to get gunked up, the cell can't process them properly. And that's what leads in some, you know, with a lot of other things going on, to neuronal death, like the proteins aren't acting properly. They're not doing what they're supposed to do, and they're stopping the cell from functioning as it should. And so because there's a sort of similar pathology, you know, in, in across neurodegenerative diseases, one of the things that we saw with the Bosutinib is and became very interested in was that this could, maybe drugs that work for ALS could also work for other neurodegenerative diseases, because even though it's a different neuronal type that's being impacted, they seem to respond the same, in very similar ways to to certain drugs.

No, that would be a good idea for us to try to formalize, actually. So there are a lot of sort of, like ad hoc efforts to try to do this. And I think one of the complicating factors is that TUDCA is not allowed for other, if people want to join a clinical trial, it's often, it's, you know, part of the exclusion criteria. And so I think that it's sort of under-reported, TUDCA uses sort of, because, it's a very benign supplement.

And so I think that, that, that could be a really productive project for us, because the, right now it's like online forums and sort of very informal, you know, Facebook surveys, who's taking TUDCA.

Speaker 1  39:29  
Yeah. And I think it's, it's a bit of a, it's a bit confusing to me. TUDCA is, because there is an Italian company, as I said, that's developing sort of clinical grade TUDCA, and I think it's already, that's sort of more of a straightforward drug repurposing effort, because I think they already market it, but I don't really know. It's a little confusing, but in the US and definitely in terms of the Amylyx compound, what makes it regulatable is that it's this combination therapy. And the other part of the combination is an FDA approved drug, sodium phenylbutyrate. So as the combination it falls undeer FDA purview.

So I think it really is making it, yeah, a standardized, and, and then also, the other really important part here is that sodium phenylbutyrate, the other part of the combination, is FDA approved, but because it's off label, most insurers will not cover it for ALS. And it's a very expensive drug. So it's up to $10,000 a month for sodium phenylbutyrate.

ProjectALS.txt,checked,,,"So one of the main priorities Project ALS has been around for 25 years at this point. And one of the main priorities really, from the beginning, was building more predictive drug screening models for ALS. So ALS is of course, a brain disease, it impacts brain cells called motor neurons. And one of the main challenges in trying to identify or develop drugs is that you can't, you don't have direct access to the cells that are impacted, right. So you can take a biopsy of someone's spinal cord and see what's going on in their motor neurons. And this was a major hurdle to drug discovery and drug development and really understanding the disease at a basic level. So from the beginning, Project ALS has been sort of a champion for stem cell models of ALS, you know, and over time has worked to improve those to the point where, you know, we were behind the first patient derived stem cell models of ALS. So, you know, in a process, you can take a skin punch from somebody who has ALS, sort of reverse time on them to make them stem cell likes induced pluripotent stem cells, it was a breakthrough from Shinya Yamanaka that won the Nobel Prize in 2006. And then make these stem cell-like cells that carry the DNA of somebody with ALS into motor neurons that you can then study in the lab. So it's not exactly the same as taking the motor neuron from the spinal cord, but it's a good stand in to actually study the human disease. And once we figured out how to do this, and you know, I'm really skipping a lot. And it's not a perfect model by any means. But what it did enable was sort of, you know, large scale drugs screens to try to see what rescues a motor neuron with ALS in a laboratory setting. And that was, you know, with our partners at Columbia, and Harvard, and other institutions, like 10 or so years ago, we just started screening 1000s of compounds of you know, some of them were drugs, it was just, you know, big compound libraries that you could buy. And that included tool compounds, things that had never been developed, supplements, things that were FDA approved. And we realized through that drug screen that there were drugs, you know, FDA approved drugs, drugs that were in development for other indications, and as I said, supplements that seemed to be somewhat effective in rescuing motor neurons in a dish in the lab. And so it really just sort of came naturally that we would see if they worked in ALS and that we would want to pursue, you know, further studies of these drugs to see if they would be suitable for repurposing and ALS","- Understanding disease mechanisms can provide the scientific research required to begin funding/undertaking large-scale drug screens

It's sort of the difference in priorities between academic institutions and people who own drugs, and like where the priorities of a patient focus nonprofit, you know, with a mission to bring treatments to people sort of lies between that. So trying to, under, you know, as I was saying earlier, like the academic goal is not really about speed at all, it's about, you know, understanding how this drug works and what that means for the biology of ALS. And, you know, it's it's about sort of like the intellectual pursuit at a baseline. And then, you know, in this case, we actually had, you know, Amylyx was quite collaborative. But still, one thing that was frustrating to us is that, you know, based on the science that we conducted, we would have recommended that TUDCA on its own, might be just as good as the combination, or actual, and actually, maybe, more better tolerated and it would be, would have been nice for, you know, a drug company to be interested in exploring that. But as you know, we were just sort of talking through that probably wouldn't be like a patentable or developable, developable drug with like money on the back end. And so they weren't interested in, you know, understanding, well, should we just be trying one of these or, you know, is the hypothesis that both of them together, work better, really true. And in the middle, you know, we just wanted this to move forward rapidly, and we wanted it to move forward in the way that would potentially have the most benefit, you know, following the science for people with ALS. And, you know, again, this was sort of a nice collaboration. And now, I'm sort of skipping to others. But one of the other drugs that we've tried, or two of the other drugs that we tried to repurpose are Pfizer cancer drugs. And they were just like, not at all interested in us looking into these drugs in ALS at all, they did not want to, you know, get data that would disrupt the currently marketed programs. And so I think that's sort of the main, the main tension for us is, yeah, trying to negotiate between like the academic groups that have a certain set of priorities, the drug companies that have a very different set of priorities, and navigate forward in a way that hopefully is ultimately helpful to people with ALS.",,,"- Academic institutions, pharma companies, and RDNPs often have extremely different goals/priorities.

So it was, you know, as I was describing, on our last call, you know, we had this idea that we wanted to set up, uh, drug screening platforms that actually, you know, reflected ALS patient biology, and would be more predictive hopefully. And that was a longtime collaboration between Project ALS and researchers at Columbia to get to the point where we could even screen for drugs. And Sunitinib was a hit compound in the same stem cell assay that we found TUDCA in, and, you know, I would just, I think I mentioned this on our last meeting. And obviously, it's sort of a tangent, but I have such a clear memory of sitting down with Dave and his family.

You know, it's an academic nonprofit group, basically, our bandwidth was, we can tell people about it, you know, there wasn't, we weren't going to be able to move it forward. And I think the issue that we saw with TUDCA is that, obviously, there's a benefit to something being available as a supplement. But it also means that it's totally unregulated, right. And so, there have been people actually, like people within the community, efforts within the community to test like, various vendors of TUDCA for their potency and purity, like, if you order like, which brands of TUDCA actually have, you know, TUDCA in it, because since it's an unregulated supplement, it can be a very low amount, you know, people get away with, the supplement industry is rife with, you know, not so great practices. And so it has, I think that was sort of the the immediate downside. And when we met Amylyx around this time, and were able to start to work with them, we tested the combination in our preclinical models with them in animal models and cellular models of ALS. It just made sense that we would sort of like hand this off, I mean, they were going to be running the study anyway. And it made sense that they would sort of take this over and make it into something that was potentially FDA approvable and available to the entire field, or the entire community. And I think that might be worth mentioning. Um, just in the context of the roadmap that you know, of course, ALS is a rare disease, but it's not the, it may not be rare in the context, it's a pretty well known and actually quite prevalent rare disease. So, it, the incidence is quite close to the incidence of MS in the US, it's just that because it's so quickly, devastating, the prevalence stays quite low because people pass away after a few years. So I think that that does give us sort of a slightly different set of considerations for a lot of these efforts than in an ultra rare disease where, you know, there's a little bit more, there are different challenges and different opportunities, I think.

PSCPartners.txt,,,,"First of all, it's important that this is oral Vancomycin and not IV Vancomycin. So this was identified by a pediatric doctor who was treating a PSC patient for C. Diff and oral Vancomycin is the standard. It's a standard treatment for a C. Diff. infection. And he noticed that the liver enzymes, the biochemical measures of liver damage seemed to improve when he went off it. After the C. Diff. cleared up, everything got worse. So out of curiosity, he put him back on it and things got better again. So he published this story, and then um, then published some other case and started putting his patients on it, all pediatric. He published a case, series of case studies. I it was like 12 or 14 patients. And that was, when was that? Probably about 15 years ago, maybe. And since then. So it's available as a off label drug, approved for C. Diff and maybe some other things that I'm not aware of, pouchitis, maybe other infections. So since then, people have been using it. There was a great controversy when, when he first published this, and people were quite upset that, that, you know, the argument was that it was going to affect whether or not clinical trials would ever be done, because people were starting to use it in these case studies. So there is a little bit of evidence published. I think there's 21 papers now, mostly observational, there were two small clinical trials, one of which was funded by PSC partners in 2009.

But again, it hasn't been well documented or well studied. And it seems, that seems to be, most patients who take it report that it helps their UC quite a bit. And then there's some for whom it seems to help their PSC as well. The other thing to notice that because it's an, the oral, apparently this is not a systemic antibiotic, it stays within the GI system. But IV Vancomycin is a very, very strong drug. And I think that most medical professionals are trained to use it with great care because of how strong it is. And so some of the controversy is around, Whoa, you're using Vancomycin when they are not, it's not necessarily clear that it's oral Vancomycin, which is slightly different in terms of the effect on the body. You know, it's limited to that one system. 

Speaker 4  29:58  
And I can't remember did we clarify to Ania that 75% to 80% of us with PSC also have IBD, mostly ulcerative colitis. So that's why we're bringing that in as - how it's affecting the ulcerative colitis. 

Speaker 5  30:12  
Yeah. And this complicates things greatly because we don't have, there's no diagnosis code for PSC with IBD. They're coded separately. And there's, there's academic debate about whether it's a separate phenotype of IBD, the PSC IBD. There's academic debate about whether or not basically all PSCers have some form of this IBD. It's just whether it has shown up, apparently, it can be identified microscopically, before there are any symptoms in many PSC patients. So

Ania K  30:45  
Is it approved for either of these other diseases you mentioned or no?

Speaker 5  30:50  
No, it is not. It's used, if it's used for ulcerative colitis, it's used off label as well.

Ania K  30:59  
And you mentioned that it's being used off label, I guess, again, you're tracking it and it's pretty common to be used off label, would you say?

Speaker 5  31:09  
It's hard to get, not many doctors will prescribe it. So there's this group that is helping people find doctors who are willing to prescribe it, there are some doctors who are vocally supportive. It's also very expensive. So that's part of

So with him when you brought that up, for Ania's purpose, I mean, to be very blunt, and especially as Mary mentioned, right now, this is, has become very, very emotional, divisive, upsetting to our entire community. And it's very frightening the effects that it may have on our organization's relationship with the researchers and clinicians that PSCPartners has worked to develop long term relationships with.

And so we funded an investigator to use, you know, a simple cell based assay and test, okay, are there any drugs in a big, large library that would increase RUNX1.

So for physicians, that was generally an easy process. For scientists, they were like, it is way too early to start prioritizing drugs. I mean, we can still learn so much about the mechanism and underlying biology. And I had to, you know, explain again, that's fine.

And some of these, like you even mentioned, like looking at the research, you know, it seems to reduce aging or even increase immune function. And that's, that's surprising since we're using it to, to reduce, reduce our immune function. Is there any, like do you have any thoughts about like, I have so many questions like, of, like, Why do you think that so many people are pursuing Sirolimus? Like, is there a reason to, like, bring, you know, literally, like, do a sirolimus club of like, everybody who's repurposing Sirolimus, like gets together, like, because, is there a value in sharing patients or data or approaches?

Speaker 1  52:33  
I think, so mTOR is just really interesting, because, I mean, it's this highly conserved, like mTORC1, mTORC2, highly conserved protein complex. And, and it's so sensitive to titration. So like, how much are you inhibiting. So if you inhibit a certain level, you, you probably will only be inhibiting mTORC1. But if you start to inhibit deeper and longer, you would inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2. And so that's I think the real difference is that, it's how you dose the drug. And how long you dose is the essential effect you're gonna get. But it is, you're right, it is interesting, right? I mean, it was just, it's used for Graft vs host disease. So it's totally counterintuitive to think that something that is so immunosuppressive would then be actually increasing immune function in, you know, an elderly population. So there was a study that was done, where they gave very low doses of ever, everolimus for six weeks, prior to 65 and older, elderly, healthy elderly population getting the influenza vaccine. And they, they showed that with six weeks and two weeks off, and then the vaccine, that those patients responded to the vaccine with, you know, higher titers, higher. I mean, it was full, it was, it was very conclusive. And so I think that's what it is. It's all about, like, how, how the complex is being inhibited. And what parts of the complex are being inhibited based on, on that dosing. And, so yeah it is really interesting.

Ania K  52:43  
And I guess my other question was, do, do you feel like there's value in, in kind of coming together? Or are these like research studies too, too different and the rare diseases that are pursuing them, do you think it's too different to kind of muddy the waters if we all get together and put all data in a bucket and see what, see what happens or something?

Speaker 1  54:45  
I mean, I think it would, I think probably the most interesting thing would be this sort of understanding how the human body responds to different doses and dosing administration, because that can be really interesting. That can be really interesting. I don't know that it would be something that you would sort of need to meet regularly, but some [sort of], you know, annual convening, virtual convening where people share the latest clinical data with, you know, Sirolimus and Everolimus and especially the safety profile, I think, would be really interesting. Yeah. And it would be interesting to also understand, you know, what are the levels of mTOR activity that are like in different patient populations that are being modulated. So like, in the case of Castlemans, are we talking about, you know, just really, really high levels of mTOR activity, as compared to you know, maybe some, a RUNX1 patient that doesn't have, you know, that's not nearly as sick as a castle—I don't know. Be, that would be interesting,

Ania K  55:57  
Mhm. Yeah. I don't know off hand of the numbers. But yeah, that's, that's really interesting. And also, I guess it brings into mind like the current, with the COVID vaccines we've had to, you know, patients have had to come off of it to - and like clear, to take the vaccine to have an immune reaction. But like, it just, it just like the idea of, of that, that smaller doses could help your immune system react to a vaccine versus us like, like having to put the patients off of it to be able to react, like that's so interesting of like, maybe you didn't have to come off, maybe just like reduce the dose? [multiple people talking] But again, like how does that work with immune systems that are, that tend to overreact to things? So that's

Speaker 1  56:43  
Completely out of whack. Yeah, I don't. Yeah. And I don't know. In the case of Castlemans, with the, the elevated mTOR activity, is that happening at the stem cell compartment? Or is that more in the B cells, T cells? The, it's probably more in the immune cells directly? Right? I don't know.

So, you know, Imatinib is the farthest we've come and we're just entering phase one in the fall. So I think you kind of got the gist of, you know, where we are. And the other [thing] I was thinking about, as you were talking about, we were talking about, you know, the strategy of whether you go after a label or you choose to go the the off label approach, and something you, it reminded me about, I wish I could remember now, it was like about cost.

Speaker 1  46:03  
Yeah, happy to. So this particular drug came out of a different lab, among some other, other targets, but this one became, was pri—. Okay, so let me back up, the way this came out was because we had a group looking at over 12 different human samples that were pre-leukaemic. And because we're interested in stem cell biology, because those are the, the actual cells that are becoming leukemic. This group did single cell RNA sequencing data, looking at the transcriptome, and found that there were several pathways that were very, very highly upregulated. And one of them was mTOR signaling. And so you know, transcriptomic data doesn't always mean like, Okay, if you find a pathway, that's something you should target immediately. But the reason I'm so interested in mTOR is because there is a lot of evidence in the aging world, in the aging research world, showing that mTOR actually extends life, lifespan, across all, all models that have ever been tested and at low doses. And so that got me really interesting, interested, because I thought, well, if mTOR signaling upregulated in the stem cell compartment in RUNX1 patients, could we already start to do a short pilot study, to understand whether just giving very low doses of mTOR, which has been shown in several clinical studies to be safe in even an elderly population, could we already start to understand what it might do in terms of RUNX1 stem cell function, RUNX1-mutated. So this is a little bit different, just because I knew from the data that exists for mTOR inhibitors, and I knew that you could dose this drug really low, and it actually increases immune function, that it made it really interesting. And so again, I think, thinking about other organizations, part of this is also just having scientists know connections from different fields even. And understanding whether a data point is interesting or not, or, or deserves more thinking, or has some sort of meaningful insight. And I don't know if this will bear out, that this will be of any interest, or that this will actually show, demonstrate an impact. But there are several, there are several physicians and in that prioritization process I was talking to you about, everyone listed mTOR as the number one drug in terms of safety profile. So it gave me a sense of comfort to really think about a pilot study and see, could we effectively, so and then on top of that, there was some other preclinical data that showed if you treated human, again, human patient cells in culture with an mTOR inhibitor, you could reverse some of the hematopoietic dysfunction, some of the blood dysfunction, so there was that as well. So it wasn't like it was just this transcriptomic data. So all of those pieces of information has got, you know, some of us pretty excited about at least starting a pilot study and testing. So that's, so this one is interesting, just because, again, the beauty of drug repurposing is you don't have to, from my perspective, with this drug, I don't need to go do and fund more preclinical mouse model work.

And this is what I was saying earlier is I have to go, I have several meetings with different clinicians to sort of pitch the idea with the PhD scientists that discover this. And we'll see where that goes. Because otherwise, if we went straight to a full blown study with 35 patients or something, you know, you're talking about a million dollars.

And so therefore, very cautious and careful about how much they're investing at the preclinical stage? Or are they just investing as much as possible at the preclinical stage, and then deciding to narrow in on one at a time once they get to that phase one, phase two?

RUNX1Research.txt,checked,,,"I guess I, you know, I need some advice or thoughts about, now that, so the way I was thinking of, now that we know we want to apply more dollars towards some of the drugs that have been identified in various projects, you know, what is the, how do we prioritize now, right, again, we have limited dollars. And so the one thing I was thinking about with setting up sort of allocating, you know, a sum of dollars each year that I can draw from, to provide monies to people who are then investigating a particular drug. But it requires what I've, what I found from the Imatinib experience is that that particular investigator ended up pulling in like, at least four other investigators at different institutions to help get access to reagents that those different groups had. So he could prove out that Imatinib did actually appear to be worthy of going into the clinic. And so what I'm trying to figure out is how do I create sort of a collaborative network which I, you know, which is what, in CDCN 's name, where I'm not, where I'm not promising that I can find everything. And so what's that process look like where I've got this sum of money, and I know, I've got, let's say, five drugs that are interesting. We've prioritized them. Am I essentially, how do I, what's, what is that? How do I figure out where to spend the dollars? Do I just say, Okay, we've prioritized mTOR, giving you an example. Now, we're going to ask people to put together a project proposal, create a collaborative network, and all my dollars for the next few years are gonna go towards mTOR. That doesn't sit well with me. Um, but at the same time, if I don't do that, and I let people apply for, you know, money each year, and there's different projects, testing different drugs, you know, is that the right approach, knowing that in the long term, I'm not going to end up funding entire projects for their entire life, like lifespan if that makes sense. So like, let's say, I give money to a group that's testing mTOR, and a group that's testing, Etanercept next year, and then the following year, the mTOR data is not looking so good. So I decide I'm going to put all the money towards Etanercept and then this other drug, I think, and I'm saying I, the Royal I, which is I mean, like my, you know, Grant Review Group. I guess I'm curious about how other groups are thinking about that like once there are, once there are clear, interesting drugs, how are they deciding to choose to invest? Because it costs a lot of money, it costs a lot of money to put money like to test, to get the preclinical data, unfortunately, not as much as a new drug. And then it costs a lot of money to do phase one and phase two. And if you can't have companies supporting you, and you don't have a relationship, you can't do everything with NIH, who's going to help you. I mean, it's just on the backs of donors.

RUNX1Research.txt,checked,,," I think the other thing we should probably discuss at some point is, you know, do we have to get FDA approval, right. So you can go after an indication, or you can decide that I'm just going to show clinically that this works and hope that physicians who care for RUNX1 patients will prescribe this off label, of course, then you're taking the risk of, you know, out of pocket costs for the patients. The good news is, of course, is that Imatinib is generic, it's off patent. So, I have, right now my thinking, and we've, you know, at least had some weigh in from some patients that it probably is safe to go this sort of non FDA approval approach and just go the off label. And then just battle insurance companies, if they, if they decide not to cover the cost, that's the current thinking. I think we still have some time, because we're just now starting phase one. And so it'll be interesting, because for us, again, like the, the, it could, it will, it looks like it will rescue the platelet phenotype, which, as I said, in the beginning of the call is, is important and has some value from a quality of life perspective. But the biggest deal is the cancer engine. And so how do we prove cancer prevention, and maybe it's just getting it approved as a platelet therapy. And then, you know, doing an observational study where patients who are on Imatinib for a long period of time, and then seeing can we see impacts on cancer prevention. That strategy I haven't really played out yet. But we're trying to figure that out, because there are some other, and we have exploratory endpoints we can measure that we think are very highly correlated with cancer evolution, which would be measuring mutations via NGS sequencing, and measuring mutation burden, like actual variant allele frequency over time. And so that's gonna, those are gonna be exploratory endpoints in the study. But they certainly won't get us FDA approval as a cancer prevention. Not, at least not at this point.

RUNX1Research.txt,checked,,,"So when I first started, I felt like, we didn't have enough data anywhere, you know, there was really no clear path where, this is, at that time, aside from the example I just gave you where, okay, let's try to find drugs can, that can raise RUNX1 activity, we didn't really know what other, what else we would need to modulate to, to prevent cancer. That's our goal, right is to prevent cancer. And so at that time, we had looked at our research portfolio, decided we were not going to put our eggs in just one or two baskets, but we would really have a diverse portfolio. And we would ask critical questions that were necessary to decide whether each of these pathways should be further investigated. So for example, for the gene editing, we know that RUNX1, we can't do gene therapy, because RUNX1 is so tightly controlled by multiple different promoters. And so it makes it really hard to do gene therapy. And it's a fairly large gene. So we knew we'd have to do gene editing. And so I did a lot of work around. Okay, what's the latest on base editing, and then, you know, what, what fundamental questions do we need to ask before we really put a lot of dollars in this area. And so then there were a couple questions we had, we had to address as sort of a gate before we put, you know, a ton of money there. And we've, we've done that. And we've had some interesting findings, but we've been very cautious about how much we fund there. And then the same thing with, there were some really interesting findings around, and they're continuing to be around inflammation and its role in providing a environment that fertilizes cancer cells, right. And, would it help you, Ania, if I give you a little more information about our disease, or should I just like so, soo let me give you a little, little bit back, uh, background. So this particular disease is driven by mutations in a gene called RUNX1. And the biggest concern for patients is not, it drives actually a platelet disorder. But it's not really severe or it doesn't really affect, it doesn't have a major quality of life impact. I mean, certainly has some, but the biggest concern is patients' high high risk of blood cancers. So what we're trying to, what the research that we're, we're funding is for that one single goal, which is to prevent cancer in these patients. And so the research portfolio is designed to, to address that. And so gene editing is one option. And then the other option is, could we target inflammation, reduce inflammation, and potentially either slow or prevent cancer. And then the other major area is, is raising RUNX1 activity through pharmacological methods. Because these mutations drive a reduction in RUNX1, so the hypothesis is, of course, if you can raise RUNX1 to what a healthy person like you and I have have, then maybe we would then reduce cancer risk. So, so we have, so we've gone into, years ago, we decided, let's invest if we identify new targets, through the inflammation sort of world and through the raising RUNX1, then, you know, maybe that's the right approach. But we had a recent board meeting this last year, where I really started to dig in and ask questions about well, if we were to find something new, and that hadn't been developed yet, what do those clinical trials look like, for cancer prevention. And that's the big stumbling block for us. Because no company, no for profit entity, right now at least, is going to put, invest in an asset that will require years and years to prove out that it can prevent cancer.

And so I basically tell people, you're gonna come in, and we're going to treat this like a lab meeting, and you're going to share with everyone. And then we have our annual conference as well. And then on top of it, I also ask people to do research webinars, just so that I keep people thinking about things, but also keep the data sharing ongoing throughout the year, and not that it's like, okay, everyone just shares their data once a year. So that's been really critical. When it comes to like drug repurposing, and this whole concept of prioritizing, what I found really interesting is that when I presented to my SAB, I have two groups of the physicians and the physician scientists, or I would, I would actually, say, the physicians, and the physician scientists that treat patients and maybe do some research. And then I have the researchers like the hardcore scientists and the physician scientists that are basically only in the lab. And it was really interesting to see the comfort level in prioritizing drugs at this stage at these very early stages. Because what I was asking them was, okay, we have all these different drugs that have been identified. Let's forget about the fact that the signal, we still need a lot more evidence to show that this might be efficacious, but I want to know before I start investing in all these projects, which one, which one of these drugs would you just completely cut off the list because the safety profile just does not make sense, like you cannot picture using this drug in a patient who doesn't have cancer, but would take it regularly to prevent cancer. So for physicians, that was generally an easy process. For scientists, they were like, it is way too early to start prioritizing drugs. I mean, we can still learn so much about the mechanism and underlying biology. And I had to, you know, explain again, that's fine. We can use these drugs to help us in experiments and identify mechanism. But I want right now, which ones would you be willing to put in the clinic based on the safety profile, profile, because that helps us understand where, you know, this is a drug that we see going towards the clinic, potentially, if we can prove out with efficacy. And here are a bunch of drugs that will help us understand, you know, mechanism, but we don't really envision this ever being a drug we would give to patients. So that prioritization process was really interesting. And the drugs I just told you that were de-prioritized, have really dirty safety profiles.

We don't net, we don't necessarily need Horizon Pharmaceuticals. There, we could go to either of the other companies that are working with PBA in different formulations. We could go to the generic companies, we could perhaps even think about contract manufacturing in an approved facility with the right medical manufacturing qualifications that are in place.

You know, so, so those are the issues, right. Everything else is kind of like it's the same, you have to find the clinician who's willing to try it. Right, there, there is a clinician who's currently administering DFMO to Bachmann Bupp patients. So there's precedent there. Nobody has been giving PBA to any polyamine disorder patient yet. So, you know, we will continue to to gather information and see which one looks more beneficial, and which one's feasible.

You don't just go from not understanding a disease to, you know, having an insurance company, reimburse the safe and effective drug without work, right. And so, I mean, we've been lucky, we have a great collaborative research network that freely shares information and works beautifully with one another, right. We've been fortunate that we've been able to participate in the million dollar bike ride, and that we've gotten this CZI Rare As One grant and the Jackson Labs has built a mouse for us, right. So we've been really, really fortunate in clearing a bunch of hurdles to get to this point, it's taken us eight years to get to where we are today, from the time we first formed as an organization, but we're still fewer than 100 patients worldwide. Right. So right now, it's basically finding a clinician, well, we have to get through, we'll have to get through the, the mouse model - that was a little slow, because a lot of the mice died, right. Because SRS is a deadly disease, and it's the yield on the mice was very little, then in addition to that, the mice were having autogenic seizures. So we weren't sure, you know, if that was the right background, are they putting the mouse in a different background, right. So, that, some, some issues in getting the mouse model established. Now we've got the mouse model, it's ready to go, we've got a drug we want to try, we've got the ability [audio cuts out] the testing and the mice, if that's successful, then we have to find a clinician that's willing to prescribe it, right. And hopefully, when the clinician is willing to prescribe at their institution will also permit them to collect data. And not take the view that this is research that's being done, under the pretext of a expanded access trial, right. And we're gonna have to find the supply of the drug again, right. And then, if we're successful, all of that, then we need to go back to the pharmaceutical companies and say, you know, we put a bow on this for you here. Here's, here's a rare disease orphan drug, that you can now take to clinical trial that's safe and is effective, and we will work with you and we have patient registry, and you don't have to go find your patients. You don't have to spend money recruiting folks for clinical trial, we got the natural history study.

So I mean, they can be quite expensive. But if there is no evidence, which, of course, the clinical trial, this clinical trial was supposed to create the evidence, then the insurance companies won't, you know, won't approve it. So, so that's another piece. And, and so the, I think that, you know, kind of the - going forward from here, one of the things that's happening is that there's a paper that's going to be written and hopefully submitted in the second half of  - it _will_ be submitted in the second half of this year, it WILL be submitted in the second half of this year. And second, our PI has started to write medical letters of necessity for, for patients who want to use it off label who weren't in the trial, and I can show you some of the data after after, you know, whenever it's the right time in this call, that they're including to support that.

Unknown Speaker  12:03  
Well, so she knew that - she knew that it was, it was the mechanism that she was targeting was a chaperone to restore the structure of STXBP1. So she, basically the the paper that that was published in September of 2018. They had screened, I think, maybe 15 different - maybe 15 to 20 - different chaperones. And they had identified three that had the, you know, the right properties of being able to restore function, and, and specifically, what they saw was removing aggregation. So from a - from a mechanism standpoint, and this again, goes back to this point about missense mutations. So the, the thinking was that, okay, I have, you know, this STXBP1 protein, I have a missense mutation, it's deforming the protein. So the deformed protein is aggregating in these missense with these missense mutations, and therefore, it's, it's literally gumming up the works in terms of - in terms of being able to - being able to facilitate communication vesicle - vesicle release with - between the neurons, and I should have talked about this. So STXBP1 is a hapless - Haploinsufficiency disorder. So people who like my daughter are making like half of what they should so they're in - what they also saw was that there is a - the bad the bad STXBP1 is also kind of aggregating the good STXBP1. So this was so this was the paper and what they found, they found three drugs, two of them were sugars, and so they didn't feel that they were appropriate candidates. Because, you know, like, even though, you know, blood brain barrier, was not the question.

And so, you know, in the vein that we were talking about before about how do you move faster? And how do you scale? You know, the thinking was, I remember when we were starting data collection for STXBP1, you know, it's time consuming. How do you get researchers interested? You know, and so this is a real way that even very small disorders can kind of immediately start data collection. And we don't assume that any disorder does or does not have certain symptoms. So it's, it starts with a very high level head to toe, and then it goes more deep. And so the benefit there is that if you don't have any characterization, or even if you have an n of one, you are able to collect a broad set of symptoms to start to characterize a disease. And so we really have been, you know, kind of positioning ourselves at the early part of the the cycle of accelerating drug therapy development. There's there we're we're being pulled downstream quite rapidly in terms of, you know, how can we support natural history? How can we support clinical trials and even real world evidence? And so, you know, that's definitely a follow up discussion that we can have. You know, where we are, where we see that Rare X can really play is in this area of what how do you develop endpoints that matter? You know, and robust endpoints. That's the that that from a data perspective is where we can really help and we do have a federation. So we so there's data that's collected directly within the platform. And then a really important component of what we're doing also is data federation, because we're not expecting that all, you know, all of the great data is going to be collected within the Rare X platform, there's, you know, and so being able to aggregate that since a lot of times, there's 20 patients here and you know, some biomarker data here, being able to provide an open platform to do that is, you know, I think, an important thing for the community. And so we're - so we're a nonprofit, we don't charge communities to be able to collect data. So that's a, you know, big, I think, a big value point for us.

And, yeah, I think that, you know, that's another thing, just going back to this issue around endpoints and, and really trying to attack the problem early. Because so for STXBP1, it's a neurodevelopmental epilepsy. And so, because we didn't have any other endpoints, we use seizures. And the - we use seizures and so that those became part of the inclusion criteria. And they're, they're important to our patients, some of our patients have, you know, seizures that are refractory even with, you know, three, three plus medication cocktails, so, but because of the seizure pattern for some of our patients, like they'll go from having a lot of seizures to having very few seizures, and you know, kind of like, goes - can go up and down. It's not the best endpoint, because you know, like it, especially - or if you've only had three seizures in the last two weeks. Did we make it better because you only had one seizure this week?

And it wasn't, so I don't want it to sound like we were - my family was the, you know, solo driver, there were five other families and all of those other families had received a diagnosis earlier. So they had been kind of on this journey a little bit longer. And everyone really wanted to accelerate therapeutic development. Because at that time, there was very little research. And so as I had described before, there were literally a handful - less than a handful - of researchers that were studying STXBP1, mainly these these folks who had come out of Thomas Südhof's lab, and, you know, so Jacqueline was one of them. And so the, so her her research into this, you know, this mechanism of, you know, mechanism of repair through a molecular chaperone, I think really started right around the time that, you know, my - probably within the first year of - after my daughter's diagnosis, and so it was really when we were starting the foundation that she started this so we were very lucky.

So, of course, now that this has happened, you know, we've from a strategy standpoint, really been saying okay, genetic therapies, you know, gene therapies. ASOs. Obviously there's a huge effort that we've been putting forward to go after those types of therapies. But we are also very, very bought into the idea that drug repurposing can provide very useful therapies, especially it - kind of before we're able to get to gene therapies.

It's FDA approved for urea cycle disorders. But because it was really a - that the thinking, which in hindsight, I don't fully agree with.

So, it's 10 patients And it is - really was positioned as a safety study, because it was the first time that it had been administered in this population. So even though it had been FDA approved -- and FDA approved from six months up -- it was still the first time in this in this population. So, yeah, so I, I would not want to do that again.

Ania K  20:51  
Right. No yeah, that's, that's great. But it's interesting, because I think in drug repurposing, like one of the benefits, I think they - people always say that you can skip the phase one, usually because it is safety. Like the safety has been proven, but it's a different enough population that they felt like it was, it was worth running a small trial?

Speaker 1  21:11  
Well, so the small trial was, I think that this is, again, like a thing of, if we were to be more aggressive now, would we just say that it's a phase two trial? Right. I think I think there's a good argument for that. Because, you know, yes, it's a neuro. It's an it's a, a developmentally delayed, you know, cognitively impaired population with seizures. But, you know, like, I don't think that the safety profile is going to be that different, you know, from from the population that the drug was originally approved for. So.

And they they had said, hey, you know, this, this drug, Ravicti or 4-phenylbutyrate could be a potential, you know, also chaperone could be a potential approach for SLC6A1. And so she was able to run experiments, while COVID that's happening to get some preclinical data.

So yeah, and probably worth - maybe too much detail. But the urea cycle mechanism is completely different. So it's not a chaperone approach.

And it there is this newer one that has - is not quite off patent, it'll go off patent I think in 2024 called Ravicti. And so at the time, the decision was the decision on which one to go with was based on tolerability which is important, you know, especially in a, you know, a population where, you know, they have significant muscle issues. So being able to swallow large, large pills is a problem. But there are also a number of kids who have G tubes, where, you know, like you can get around the problem and they - there was no consideration given to cost.

Can we go with compounding, you know, like, we would have started to look at that more upfront, during COVID While we were shut down, that's an example. But we went with Ravicti.

So, Horizon pharmaceuticals acquired Ravicti and so, there there were multiple outreaches to, you know, try to get drug for the trial.

And then I'm telling you this, and then tell me how it's going to be used, because I do want you to know this, but there's some sensitivity to it, because we've now asked them for another year, so I don't want them to get mad. But basically, they they reneged on that commitment. And so it was in the protocol. And so they reneged on the commitment, and then it got very ugly. And then it got a - there was there, there they were, they started to get concerned about their reputation within the rare disease community. And then they agreed to give it.

We needed about $250,000. $100,000 for the UK. And and and because - because of the exchange in money, right, the money system we anticipated about $150,000 for a cohort in the United States to run on on - we decided the age level because it was hard to get it in pediatrics. So we we preliminary decided that if we designed a trial we'd start out with the age of 10, because the FDA for a repurposed drug would would more likely be approved at the age of 10. And not any younger, especially for a drug of this type, because we did not know how it behaves in younger pediatric populations. So that's when the German scientists decided to run a small cohort on on this drug. Because of the, because of the small numbers, and I can't remember, I think it was 14, I want to say 14 patients at the time in Germany, and then one in Sweden is - one in Sweden, and then they had one in Austria, I believe, join this cohort.

What what are what are you seeing in terms of not just control of seizures, but when you pair it with the the seizure medication? What are the three top drugs basically, that you use for ADHD, which also calms the the nervous system, and, you know, went back to the database and the majority, I would say, it's a third, third and third, and so we narrowed it down to clonidine. Then, guanasonafine and Risperdal or Risperidone. And we noticed that the, when you're looking at the set, actually your side effects, so we collect the side effects as well, we collect the side effects and the benefits of these drugs that the kiddos are taking. And we noticed that there was an improvement in sleep. And there is an improvement in their behavior and their sensory processing, especially when it comes to transitioning from one thing to another. And we honestly haven't collected the data on pain threshold, but when we went back to our Facebook group, which is actually where we initially found sensory processing mechanism, we asked patients to answer just just a blanket statement: does your patie - do your patients have high or low pain thresholds? And that set us onto a target, which is that real world data. So we designed a survey, we kind of worked in back - we kind of worked in backwards mode.

Speaker 1  48:24  
Yeah, it's. Yeah, I think they did because they weren't sure. I - one of the - one of the one of the pitfalls was a, they weren't getting the correct results in the smaller cohort, even though there were some benefits in some of the patients and and then, and then also another issue was that COVID hit. So when COVID hit, it's kind of like everything stopped because, you know, there was just no reason to to continue to recruit or even to plan anything that that became now backburner because of that preliminary data. And and the Fycompa, I think happened with the same thing, even though - now, they have several papers. Johns Hopkins did the five, the Fycompa. And they did present on it in our 2019 meeting in November, the data on that, that that seemed relatively good data in comparison to the EEG patterns, not to treat epilepsy, but it calmed the brain at low doses so that the children - the sleep improved So we have, we have several drugs because one, of course, one of the biggest issues, next to the seizures and behavior, is sleep, because you can't function without sleep. So that's that's how sleep became a top issue for us as well. Of course, you know, it's just so very variable, but we had to narrow it down to certain priorities. And I think the repurposed drug Fycompa. And that's the brand name, because Eisai makes it. Um, and I don't think it's reached a patented, you know, the recent release of a patent yet. So that's why it became so attractive to scientists to try it, because - and that was all real world data as well, because sci- you know, the clinician started to, when other other pharmaceuticals weren't working on epilepsy, they would just go through the line, right, they would just go down the list and try every single epileptic medication. And how they they noticed that that it became a trend is that once you titrate up on that drug, you notice a difference - same behavior, but it's still not controlling the seizures, which the whole point of, of providing that drug is to treat the seizures.

Then they started working on trying to find a sleep outcome, which we did find using a validated survey. So we now have an outcome for sleep, a validated outcome for sleep. So depending on the results of what they find in the animal model data, we can then take the information that we've collected and the database from the from the families for, you know, because we collect data that's observational recorded outcomes, and that's how we transition that basic science into a mechanism for this particular protein and how this protein behaves.

And that was just happenstance, I met this this this pain doctor who treats opioid addicts. And and and these these people that are addicted and get addicted to these pain medications. He goes well, that's odd you say that, because I was telling him the effect that it had on my son because of course, of course, I can't speak to anyone else, to anyone else trying to - trying this, this particular drug. And he goes, That's odd. Because well, because I use Clonidine patches to, to, for these pain patients that are on opioids, and have opioid addiction and cannot tolerate pain. It's - he told me that even the small touch of skin, just fingertips on skin. These people people are super hyper sensitive to touch and pain, they cannot tolerate pain. He goes, So I use Clonidine patches to reduce that effect. That's when I took that information. I started looking, of course, and - 'cause he told me there's some research papers, but he couldn't, he could not tell me this, this, this data, this off data of the some of the symptoms of the sensory processing right, of this drug. Well, I went back and I found a paper on clonidine patches, and increasing the threshold of - or decreasing the threshold of pain, which is totally opposite of what our patients feel. I mean, black and white, it's black and white response to the same drug on different people, different groups - subgroups. So I took that paper and I said Dr. Gavin, I found something.
