<p>Throughout 2021-2022 the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN) has conducted a survey of US-based rare disease non profit organizations (RDNPs) and their stakeholder populations (patients, loved ones, physicians and researchers). </p>

<p>
    We had 147 organizations participate, and along with their stakeholders we received over 1,900 survey responses. </p>

    <p>
    
    In the following report, we would like to present a high-level overview of the findings from our data to help provide answers to some fundamental questions regarding the state of rare disease drug repurposing in the US.</p>


    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The CDCN reached out to 755 US-based rare disease non-profit organizations on 9/29/2021,  and throughout the next two months 147 (19.4%) organizations participated in the survey. _____/% of these also forwarded the survey on to their patient, loved one, physician and researcher communities.
